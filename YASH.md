## Core Components

### 1. Plant Data Processing

#### Data Sources
- **flower_plants_data.csv**: Ornamental plants
- **herbs_plants_data.csv**: Culinary and medicinal herbs
- **vegetable_plants_data.csv**: Edible vegetables

#### Normalization Process
The `normalization.py` module processes raw CSV data into a consistent format:
- Text cleaning (removing markdown)
- Parsing time-to-maturity values
- Extracting sowing months by climate zone
- Deriving plant characteristics:
  - Sun needs from position text
  - Container suitability
  - Indoor growing suitability
  - Plant habit (climber, dwarf, compact, etc.)
  - Maintainability score based on hardiness
  - Edibility determination
  - Fragrance detection
  - Flower color extraction
  - Image path selection

### 2. Recommendation Engine

#### Main Processing Flow (engine.py)
1. **Data Loading**: Load and normalize all plant data
2. **Environment Selection**: Select climate data based on suburb
3. **Hard Filtering**: Apply strict filters (season, goal, site requirements)
4. **Filter Relaxation**: Expand candidates if needed to meet target count
5. **Scoring**: Calculate scores using weighted factors
6. **Diversity Capping**: Limit recommendations per category
7. **Output Assembly**: Generate final JSON output

#### Scoring System (scoring.py)
Weighted scoring with the following factors:
- **Season compatibility** (25% weight): Sowing period match
- **Sun compatibility** (20% weight): Site condition match
- **Maintainability** (15% weight): User preference alignment
- **Time to results** (10% weight): Quick vs. patient results
- **Site fit** (10% weight): Container, space, location compatibility
- **User preferences** (12% weight): Edible/ornamental types, colors, fragrance
- **Wind penalty** (3% weight): Tall plants in windy conditions
- **Eco bonus** (5% weight): Pollinator-friendly plants

### 3. Climate Data Integration

#### Data Sources
The CLIMATE_DATA system integrates data from:
- **Open-Meteo**: Weather data (temperature, humidity, wind, pressure)
- **WAQI**: Air quality data (AQI, pollutants)
- **ARPANSA**: UV index data

#### Coverage
- 151+ Melbourne suburbs with GPS coordinates
- Real-time data collection
- Optimized data collection using best source for each parameter

#### Integration Approach
The system uses an optimized approach:
- Open-Meteo for weather parameters (best accuracy, no API key required)
- WAQI for air quality (comprehensive pollutant data)
- ARPANSA for UV index (official Australian government source)

## API Integration

### Open-Meteo Integration
- Free tier with no rate limits
- GPS coordinate-based requests
- Provides temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, precipitation
- No authentication required

### WAQI Integration
- Free tier with 1000 requests/minute limit
- Requires API token (provided)
- Provides AQI and detailed pollutant levels
- Maps GPS coordinates to nearest monitoring station

### ARPANSA Integration
- No rate limits
- Provides official UV index data
- Updates every minute during daylight hours
- No authentication required

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: JSON preferences file
2. **Plant Data Loading**: CSV files normalized into consistent dictionaries
3. **Climate Data Selection**: Based on suburb name or Richmond fallback
4. **Filtering**: Hard filters applied (season, goal, site requirements)
5. **Scoring**: Each candidate plant scored against user preferences
6. **Ranking**: Plants sorted by composite score
7. **Diversity**: Category diversity cap applied
8. **Output**: JSON recommendations with explanations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Hard Filtering Logic
The engine applies these filters in sequence:
1. **Season Filter**: Only plants sowable in current month
2. **Goal Filter**: Match plant type to user goal (edible/ornamental/mixed)
3. **Indoor Filter**: Indoor requirement check
4. **Container Filter**: Container suitability check
5. **Sun Filter**: Strict sun exposure matching

### Filter Relaxation
If initial filtering doesn't produce enough candidates:
1. **Season Expansion**: Include plants sowable in ±1 month
2. **Sun Relaxation**: Allow sun difference up to 2 levels
3. **Final Fallback**: Return what's available

### Scoring Algorithm
Each plant receives a composite score:
1. Calculate sub-scores for each factor (0.0-1.0)
2. Apply weights to each sub-score
3. Calculate base score (0-100)
4. Apply wind penalty (multiplicative)
5. Sort by score descending

### Deduplication
Plants are deduplicated by:
1. Canonical ID (scientific name or plant name)
2. Keep highest-ranked occurrence
3. Applied after scoring and sorting

## Performance Considerations

### Processing Time
- Data loading: ~100ms
- Filtering: ~50ms
- Scoring: ~200ms (depends on candidate count)
- Total: ~1-3 seconds

### Memory Usage
- Plant data: ~10MB in memory
- Climate data: ~5MB in memory
- Peak usage: ~15MB

### Scalability
- Current implementation handles ~5000 plants efficiently
- Climate data system handles 151+ suburbs
- No database required (all file-based)

## Future Improvements

### Performance
- Implement caching for climate data
- Optimize scoring algorithm
- Add parallel processing for large datasets

### Features
