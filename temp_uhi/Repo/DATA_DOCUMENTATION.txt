MELBOURNE HEAT ISLAND INTEGRATED DATASET DOCUMENTATION
=====================================================

DATA SOURCES USED IN CHOROPLETH MAP:
-----------------------------------
1. PRIMARY SOURCE: HEAT_URBAN_HEAT_2018.shp
   - Original shapefile with 55,603 mesh blocks
   - Contains geographic boundaries (polygons)
   - Heat intensity data (UHI18_M field)
   - Vegetation coverage data (multiple fields)
   - Australian Bureau of Statistics geographic codes

2. PROCESSING APPLIED:
   - Dissolved mesh blocks by suburb (SA2_NAME16) to create boundaries
   - Calculated average heat intensity per suburb
   - Converted coordinate system to WGS84 for web mapping
   - Added heat categories based on temperature ranges

CHOROPLETH MAP DATA USAGE:
-------------------------
• BOUNDARY SHAPES: From dissolved mesh block geometries
• FILL COLORS: Based on average heat intensity per suburb (UHI18_M field)
• POPUP DATA: Aggregated vegetation and heat statistics
• TOOLTIPS: Suburb name and average heat value

CSV FILE CONTENTS:
-----------------
1. melbourne_heat_integrated_dataset.csv (55,603 records)
   - Every individual mesh block with all original data
   - Added coordinates, area calculations, and categories
   - Complete dataset for detailed analysis

2. melbourne_suburbs_aggregated.csv (323 records)
   - One record per suburb with averaged values
   - Same aggregation used in the choropleth map
   - Rankings and summary statistics included

FIELD DESCRIPTIONS:
------------------
HEAT_INTENSITY_CELSIUS: Urban Heat Island effect in degrees Celsius
  • Positive values = hotter than surrounding rural areas
  • Negative values = cooler than surrounding rural areas
  • Range: -8.92°C to 16.89°C

VEGETATION FIELDS: Percentage coverage of different vegetation types
  • TOTAL_VEGETATION_PCT: All vegetation combined
  • TREE_COVERAGE_PCT: All trees combined
  • Tree height categories: Small (3-10m), Medium (10-15m), Large (15m+)

GEOGRAPHIC CODES:
  • MB_CODE16: Mesh Block (smallest census unit)
  • SA2_NAME16: Suburb/locality name (used for choropleth boundaries)
  • LGA: Local Government Area (council)

HEAT CATEGORIES:
  • Extreme Heat: 12°C and above (1,806 mesh blocks)
  • High Heat: 8°C to 12°C (33,777 mesh blocks)
  • Moderate Heat: 4°C to 8°C (17,700 mesh blocks)
  • Low Heat: 0°C to 4°C (2,047 mesh blocks)
  • Cool: Below 0°C (273 mesh blocks)
