# Melbourne Urban Heat Island Dataset - Data Engineer Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides technical details for data engineers to work with the processed Melbourne Urban Heat Island dataset. The data has been preprocessed from raw shapefiles into analysis-ready CSV format with suburb-level aggregations.

## Data Processing Pipeline Summary

### Source Data Processing
1. **Original Source**: `HEAT_URBAN_HEAT_2018.shp` - ABS mesh block level shapefile (55,603 records)
2. **Preprocessing Steps**:
   - Loaded raw shapefile with geopandas
   - Converted coordinate system from EPSG:7855 to EPSG:4326 (WGS84)
   - Calculated mesh block centroids for coordinate extraction
   - Dissolved mesh blocks by suburb name (SA2_NAME16) to create suburb boundaries
   - Aggregated heat and vegetation data using statistical functions (mean, min, max, std, count)
   - Added derived fields for analysis (heat categories, rankings, area calculations)
   - Generated centroid coordinates for each suburb

### Aggregation Methodology
- **Spatial Aggregation**: Mesh blocks grouped by Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2_NAME16)
- **Heat Data**: Mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation calculated per suburb
- **Vegetation Data**: Mean percentages calculated across all mesh blocks in each suburb
- **Geographic Data**: Suburb centroids calculated from dissolved polygon geometries

Cool: < 0.0°C
```

## Technical Notes

### Data Quality
- **Completeness**: No missing values in any field
- **Coordinate System**: WGS84 (EPSG:4326) for global compatibility
- **Temporal Scope**: Heat data collected in 2018
- **Spatial Coverage**: Melbourne metropolitan area (35+ councils)

### Statistical Considerations
- Heat intensity represents deviation from rural baseline temperatures
- Positive values indicate urban heat island effect (hotter than surroundings)
- Negative values indicate cooling effect (cooler than surroundings)
- Vegetation percentages sum may exceed 100% due to overlapping categories

### Recommended Analysis Approaches
1. **Correlation Analysis**: Heat vs vegetation coverage relationships
2. **Spatial Analysis**: Geographic clustering of heat intensities
3. **Statistical Modeling**: Predictive models for heat based on vegetation
4. **Ranking Analysis**: Priority suburbs for cooling interventions

## Data Validation
- **Total Records**: 323 suburbs
- **Geographic Coverage**: All major Melbourne suburbs included
- **Heat Range Validation**: Values consistent with urban heat island literature
- **Coordinate Validation**: All coordinates within Melbourne metropolitan bounds

## Integration Recommendations
- Use `SUBURB_NAME` as primary key for joins with other datasets
- `CENTROID_LONGITUDE` and `CENTROID_LATITUDE` for spatial joins
- `HEAT_CATEGORY` for categorical analysis and visualization
- `AVG_HEAT_CELSIUS` for continuous statistical analysis
