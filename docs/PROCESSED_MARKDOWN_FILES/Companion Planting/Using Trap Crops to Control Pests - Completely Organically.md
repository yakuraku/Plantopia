# Using Trap Crops to Control Pests – Completely Organically

*Losing a prized plant to pests is a universal gardener’s heartbreak. While a quick spray of pesticide can silence the problem, it often harms the beneficial insects that keep your garden thriving. If you’re looking for a natural, hands‑on solution, **trap crops** (also called decoy or sacrificial crops) are a game‑changer.*

## What Exactly Are Trap Crops?

**Trap crops** are companion plants deliberately chosen to attract pests away from your main crops.  
- They act as a *lure*, drawing insects to a single, easy‑to‑manage area.  
- Once the pests congregate, you can harvest, bag, burn, or vacuum them up for disposal.  
- Because they’re grown specifically for this purpose, they’re usually fast‑growing and inexpensive to replace.

### How to Handle the Infested Decoys

| Method | When to Use | How to Dispose |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Hand‑pick** | Light infestations | Bag, burn, or squish |
| **Vacuum** | Heavy infestations | Use a handheld vacuum; empty contents into a sealed bag |
| **Uproot & Burn** | Mature, heavily infested plants | Remove whole plant, bag, then burn or compost in a sealed container |

*Tip:* If the sacrificial plant grows quickly, wait until it’s heavily infested before removing it—this gives you a single, manageable cleanup.

## How to Choose a Trap Crop

Pick a decoy that’s **more attractive** to the target pest than your main crop, yet **quick and easy** to grow.  
Common pairings include:

- **Nasturtiums** – aphids, whiteflies, cabbage moths  
- **Upland cress** – cabbage moths  
- **Sunflowers** – green vegetable bugs, stink bugs  
- **Mustard** – harlequin bugs  
- **Dandelion & marshmallow** – weevils  
- **Marigolds** – root‑knot nematodes  
- **Sorghum** – corn earworms  

*Keep an eye on your garden’s pest behavior.* If a fast‑growing herb attracts a particular bug, it might be a perfect sacrificial crop for your next season.

## Working with Trap Crops

To maximize effectiveness, consider these practical tips:

- **Positioning**  
  - *Border*: Surround your main crop with trap plants to create a natural barrier.  
  - *Interplanting*: Mix decoys within the main crop for direct lure.  
  Experiment to find what works best for your pests.

- **Space Allocation**  
  - Aim for **≈20 % of your planting area** dedicated to trap crops.  
  - Adjust based on results and available space.

- **Timing**  
  - Plant trap crops **early** so they’re established when pests arrive.  
  - Ensure they mature **before** the main crop to attract pests first.

- **Growth Rate**  
  - Fast‑growing species allow quick replacement after infestation.

- **Diversity**  
  - Use multiple trap crops targeting the same pest to reduce the chance of your main crop becoming the primary target.

## When Trap Crops Are Too Successful

Trap crops can *backfire* if left unchecked:

- They may become a *permanent food source*, encouraging pests to stay.  
- Continuous monitoring and removal throughout the growing season are essential.  
- If you neglect this, the decoy could *exacerbate* the problem rather than solve it.

## Trap Crops as Part of a Bigger Picture

Trap crops are a powerful tool, but they’re most effective when combined with other organic strategies:

- **Attract beneficial insects** (ladybugs, lacewings) and birds.  
- **Maintain garden hygiene** – remove debris, rotate crops.  
- **Practice crop rotation** to prevent pest buildup.

*Remember:* Organic pest control isn’t a quick fix like chemical spray, but it’s a more satisfying, sustainable approach that boosts botanical diversity. By integrating trap crops into your routine, you’ll have a natural, effective line of defense in your garden’s pest‑control toolbox.
