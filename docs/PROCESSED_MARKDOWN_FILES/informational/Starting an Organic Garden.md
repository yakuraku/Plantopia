# Starting an Organic Garden

30 August 2025  

*Starting an Organic Garden*  
To the novice gardener, the prospect of starting an organic garden can seem daunting. There are a lot of confusing terms; even the word **“organic”** can have multiple meanings. You might not know where to buy what you need, especially if you live in a part of the country where organic gardening has not yet taken root. You might not even know what you need to get started, and what, if any, supplies you already have that will be suitable. Relax. Once you grasp the basics, going green in your garden is simple, healthy, and fun.

## What is Organic?

What does *organic* mean, exactly?  
For most gardeners, **organic** simply means that no artificial fertilizers, pesticides, or genetically modified organisms are used during the growing process.

- **Artificial fertilizers** are made from non‑living materials (e.g., ammonium sulfate from ammonia + sulfuric acid) and can damage soil over time and be toxic to humans and animals.  
- **Chemical pesticides** are poisons that may remain on plants after washing, contaminate soil and groundwater, and harm pets, children, and beneficial insects like bees and butterflies.

To avoid introducing any artificial chemicals, look for soils and fertilizers labeled **Certified Organic**. Most garden centers and home‑improvement stores carry them.

## Things To Do Before You Start

Preparation makes every aspect of your garden easier to manage.

- **Check your soil structure.**  
  *Sandy loam* is ideal: a good balance of sand, clay, and silt.  
  *How to test:* Take a handful (preferably two days after a good rainfall) and pinch it between thumb and forefinger.  
  - Slimy or slippery → excess clay  
  - Powdery → too much silt  
  - Gritty → too much sand  

  *Adjust with organic matter:* compost, manure, or worm castings.

- **Decide what to grow.**  
  Allocate space for flowers, herbs, fruits, vegetables, or a mix. Choose plants suited to your region to reduce stress and boost yield.

- **Use companion planting.**  
  Plant pest‑reducing pairs together:  
  - Beets + onions  
  - Carrots + dill  
  - Garlic + roses  
  - Spinach + strawberries

- **Choose your location wisely.**  
  Give plants enough room, avoid high‑traffic areas, and match sun/shade needs. Check drainage—avoid spots that stay too wet or too dry after rain.

- **Draw a garden map.**  
  Plan rows and sections or go for a “random” layout—pick what feels most useful and appealing.

- **Assemble your tools.**  
  Essentials: trowel, gardening fork, watering can or hose, shovel, secateurs, and a cart or wheelbarrow.

## Getting Your Space Ready For Planting

Once you’ve chosen a site and mapped it out, prepare the soil.

1. **Remove existing vegetation.**  
   The most common method is to excavate the top layer. This removes contaminated plants but also loses topsoil—an undesirable trade‑off.

2. **Consider a lasagna garden.**  
   - Lay corrugated cardboard over the area.  
   - Wet it thoroughly, then layer greens (grass clippings, plant trimmings, veggie scraps) and browns (peat moss, coffee grounds, fallen leaves) to ~60 cm depth.  
   - *Pros:* Retains topsoil, creates a healthy habitat for earthworms.  
   - *Cons:* Takes time to break down, best set up in autumn.

3. **Amend existing soil.**  
   If the soil structure is poor, till in compost, manure, or other amendments.  
   - **Rule of thumb:** *Once, then done.* Frequent tilling strips nutrients, dries the earth, and erodes topsoil.  
   - Encourage worm colonization for a natural, sustainable alternative.

4. **Raised beds or containers.**  
   If you’re worried about pre‑existing contamination, these options let you control exposure, reduce pest pressure, and preserve precious topsoil.

## Planting and Transplanting Seedlings

Most gardeners can plant seeds directly in the ground, but early‑season or cool‑climate growers may need to start indoors or in a greenhouse.

- **Night before planting:** Water seedlings well.  
- **Best time to transplant:** Afternoon or early evening on an overcast, slightly cool day.  
- **Digging holes:** Make them about twice the size of the root ball.  
- **Preparing the hole:** Create a mound of soil so the depth matches the container depth.  
- **Removing the plant:** Turn the pot upside down, hold the plant, tap the bottom until it slides free.  
  - If roots are compacted, gently loosen and spread them.  
  - For biodegradable peat pots, score the sides or trim the lip to prevent moisture wicking away from roots.  
- **Planting:** Set the seedling on the mound, adjust soil depth, then fill the hole.  
- **Water immediately** and keep the new plant well hydrated for the first week.  
- **Shade if needed:** Protect seedlings from hot, sunny days.

## Mulch

Mulch is a gardener’s best friend— it blocks pests, suppresses weeds, retains moisture, and regulates temperature.

- **Choose the right mulch:**  
  - **Vegetable/herb gardens or annual beds:** Use fast‑decomposing mulches like compost, lucerne, or straw.  
  - **Perennial gardens:** Opt for longer‑lasting mulches such as stones or woodchips.  
  - **Avoid pine mulch** in acidic soils because of its high acid content.

- **Application:** Spread a 6 cm layer, keeping mulch 3 cm away from plant stems to avoid moisture wicking.

- **Experiment:** The best mulch for your garden may vary—try different options and see what works best.

## Compost

Compost is the ultimate organic fertilizer, made from kitchen or yard waste.

- **Sources:** Vegetable scraps, lawn clippings, coffee grounds, etc.  
- **Containers:** Boxes, barrels, or a backyard pile if space allows.  
- **Starter kits** are widely available at department stores, grocery stores, and home‑improvement centers.  
- **If you’re short on time or space,** pre‑made compost bags can be purchased at most gardening suppliers.

## Maintenance

Early detection keeps problems under control.

- **Weeding:** Do it daily if possible. Young weeds (volunteers) are easy to pull; older ones are tougher.  
- **Pest control:**  
  - Hand‑remove pests when feasible.  
  - Use worm compost (vermicompost) to deter aphids and caterpillars.  
  - Plant companion species that attract predatory insects or birds.  
  - Herbs like mint, garlic, horseradish, and rosemary repel beetles, moths, flies, and mosquitoes.

- **Watering:**  
  - Aim for consistent moisture; rainfall is helpful but not guaranteed.  
  - **Soaker hoses** (plastic or canvas) deliver a slow, steady trickle.  
  - Connect soaker hoses to rain‑water tanks that collect gutter runoff—this system conserves water, reduces erosion, and cuts pollution.

## The Fruits of Your Labor

Once your garden thrives, you’ll enjoy a tranquil retreat filled with fragrant herbs, vibrant flowers, and nutritious vegetables—all grown naturally without harmful chemicals. Celebrate your hard work, give yourself a pat on the back, and most importantly—enjoy the harvest!
