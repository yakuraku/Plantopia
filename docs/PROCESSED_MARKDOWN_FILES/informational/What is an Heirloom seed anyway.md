# What is an Heirloom seed anyway?

*30 August 2025*

Many of our customers ask whether our seeds qualify as heirloom. The answer isn’t a simple **yes** or **no**. Even when we talk about a single variety, the definition can be tricky. Do you know what an heirloom seed really means?

## The core criteria

The term _heirloom_ sparks debate, but there are three core criteria that almost everyone agrees on:

1. **Open‑pollinated** – These varieties are pollinated by insects, birds, wind, or other natural means. They’re more genetically diverse, and when grown in isolation they produce seed that is *true to type*.
2. **Classic breeding practices** – Heirloom seeds must be bred and stabilized using traditional, non‑modern techniques.
3. **No genetic modification** – Any genetically modified seed cannot be considered heirloom.

## The big question: How long must a seed exist?

If a seed meets those three criteria, is it automatically heirloom? That’s where the debate really starts.

4. **Longevity** – The required age of a seed is the most contested point. Opinions vary:

   * Some say a seed must have originated **over 50 years ago**.
   * Others argue for **over 100 years**.
   * A few insist it must have been available **before 1945** (end of World War II).
   * Still others set the bar at **before 1951** (the start of widespread hybrid seed introduction).

Some people even use _heirloom_ literally, referring to a variety that has been nurtured and selected by a family, farm, or small community for generations.

## Are the seeds at _TheSeedCollection_ heirloom?

**Yes—many of our varieties qualify as heirloom.**  
Almost all of them are open‑pollinated, which we consider the most important trait. Plus, none of our seeds are genetically modified or chemically treated.

### Practical tips for choosing heirloom seeds

- **Look for the open‑pollinated label** – This guarantees natural pollination and genetic diversity.
- **Check the seed’s age** – If you’re strict about longevity, ask the supplier for the year of release or the seed’s history.
- **Avoid GMOs** – Stick to suppliers that certify their seeds as non‑genetically modified.
- **Consider local heritage** – If a seed has been grown in your region for generations, it’s likely a true heirloom.
- **Plant in isolation** – To preserve the variety’s traits, grow heirloom seeds away from hybrid or GMO crops.

By keeping these points in mind, you’ll be well on your way to cultivating authentic heirloom plants in your garden.
