# Plants to Grow to Supplement Your Chickens’ Feed

*Plants to Grow to Supplement Your Chickens’ Feed*

Chickens are nature’s ultimate recyclers. A few chooks can turn kitchen scraps into valuable nitrogen for your garden (via their manure) and protein for you (through their eggs).  

In a tight home‑garden, chickens are a fantastic way to harvest weeds, soft prunings, and even leftover food—without the need for a huge plot. But why stop at waste? Growing a few crops just for your feathered friends can boost their nutrition, improve egg quality, and give them a richer, more stimulating diet.

> **Tip:** A balanced commercial mix is still essential for protein, especially during egg‑laying. Think of home‑grown greens and seeds as tasty supplements, not a full replacement.

## 1. Leafy Greens

Leafy greens are nutritional powerhouses for humans—and chickens too! They’re packed with iron, vitamins C, A, and K, and the darker the leaf, the richer the yolks you’ll see.

- **Why chickens love them:** They’re easy to forage and can eat large amounts.
- **Variety keeps demand in check** and offers a spectrum of health benefits.

### Chook‑Friendly Greens

| Plant | Key Benefit | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Silverbeet** | Rich in nutrients | Harvest outer leaves; compost larger stalks if needed |
| **Nasturtiums** | High in vitamin C, may encourage laying | Also attract pollinators |
| **Lettuce** | Fast‑growing, bulk crop | Ideal for quick harvest |
| **Kale** | High in calcium | Supports shell production |
| **Cabbage & Brassicas** | Adds folate | Good for feather health and egg yield |
| **Pak choi** | Vitamin C source | Strengthens immune system |

> **Pro tip:** When you’re picking your own veggies, toss the outer leaves and any damaged parts to the chickens before you take the rest to the kitchen. If those leaves come with a side‑dish of caterpillars, even better—chickens are omnivores and love a bug snack!

## 2. Plants to Dry for Seed

Not every plant needs to be fresh. Letting some mature to seed gives you a long‑lasting, nutrient‑dense snack that keeps your chooks entertained.

### Best Seed‑Producing Plants

- **Amaranth**
- **Sunflower**
- **Corn**
- **Pumpkin**

These plants yield plenty of seeds, making them worth growing even on a small scale.

#### How to Dry Seeds

1. **Cut** the seed heads and a bit of stem.
2. **Hang** them to dry in place.
3. **Scrape** off seeds as needed and feed directly to the chickens.

> **Pumpkin seeds** can be scraped from the fruit’s center—serve fresh (with the stringy flesh) or dry them for winter use.

## 3. Sprouts

Sprouted seeds are a fresh, protein‑rich addition to both your meals and your chickens’ diet—especially handy in cooler months when forage is scarce.

### Popular Sprouting Seeds

- Wheatgrass
- Alfalfa
- Chickpeas
- Oats

> **Caution:** Avoid sprouting large bean seeds (e.g., kidney beans) in bulk, as they can be toxic to chickens.

#### Sprouting Steps

1. **Rinse** seeds and spread on a shallow tray.  
2. **Cover** with lukewarm water; soak for 12 hrs.  
3. **Drain**, rinse, and drain again.  
4. **Place** tray in a dark, warm spot.  
5. **Rinse & drain** 1–2 × day until shoots reach 3.5–5 cm.  
6. **Expose** to sunlight for ~15 min or until shoots turn green to boost nutrition.

## 4. Sunflowers

If you grow sunflowers for their beauty, you’ll likely end up with more seed heads than you can handle. Simply drop a whole head into the run—your chickens will enjoy the pecking fun, and the seeds are a protein boost during autumn moulting.

## 5. Mulberry Trees

If your run is spacious enough, plant a **mulberry** (or similar fruit tree) inside. It’ll provide shade on hot days and drop ripe, vitamin‑C‑rich snacks throughout summer—an extra sweet treat for your chickens.

### Bottom Line

All these plant ideas are easy to grow and won’t dent your feed budget. By giving your chickens a varied, nutritious diet, you’ll raise happier, healthier birds that reward you with more and better eggs.
