## The Basics  

If you have **one or more spots that receive at least six hours of direct sunlight each day**, you’re already on the right track—whether that spot is a sunny patch in your garden, a patio, or a balcony.  
* Evaluate the space you have.
* Decide how best to use it.

Many vegetables and fruits thrive in tight spaces when they get enough water and light. Hybrid varieties that stay small are great, but **heirloom and open‑pollinated crops** can also do well in containers or compact beds.

## Practical Tips for Growing in Small Spaces  

| Tip | What It Means | Why It Helps |
|-----|---------------|--------------|
| **Use pots or containers** | Grow berries, herbs, greens, tomatoes, and chillies in pots. | Containers give you control over soil, drainage, and watering. |
| **Go vertical** | Train vines (cucumbers, melons) on trellises, lattice, wire, or fences. | Saves floor space and keeps plants healthy. |
| **Raised beds** | Build or buy beds that fit your space; place them on patios or courtyards. | Deep beds (≥30 cm) are ideal for root crops. |
| **Hanging baskets** | Hang leafy greens and strawberries on patios. | Adds beauty and frees up ground space. |
| **Other hanging planters** | Use gutters, upcycled bottles, plastic pots, or felt bags on walls/fences. | Maximizes every vertical surface. |
| **Mix edibles with ornamentals** | Fill gaps between decorative plants with small crops. | Utilizes every inch of your garden. |

**Key reminders**

- **Drainage is essential**: Containers without holes will drown roots.  
- **Container size matters**: Follow the plant’s recommended pot size for healthy root development.  
- **Support is often needed**: Stake heavy fruiting plants to keep them upright.

## Soil, Food, and Water  

1. **Start with quality potting mix**  
   - Any mix meeting the Australian Standard works.  
   - Vegetable‑specific mixes with compost and slow‑release granules are a great choice.  

2. **Fertilize wisely**  
   - Containers drain faster, so nutrients wash away more quickly.  
   - Use a liquid fertilizer periodically—follow the label to avoid over‑feeding.  

3. **Watering schedule**  
   - **Summer**: Water twice daily (morning & late afternoon). Avoid midday watering.  
   - **Cooler months**: Water only when the top 5 cm of soil feels dry.  

4. **Check the soil**  
   - In containers, the soil can dry out quickly; keep an eye on moisture levels.
