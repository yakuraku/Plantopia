# The 3 R's: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

30 August 2025  
*The 3 R’s: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle*  

Once upon a time the 3 R’s were “reading”, “writing” and “arithmetic”.  
Today we talk about **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**.  
Why does only **Recycle** get the spotlight?  
Because we all know that to protect the planet we must recycle metals, paper and plastics.  
So we dutifully fill our recycle bins and then… nothing more.  

If you’re curious, drop by your local transfer station.  
Everything you see there is *not* going to a landfill and will one day become a new product—think of the compost bins below made from 100 % recycled plastic.

## Reduce

As gardeners, we already understand **Reduce**:  
- Avoid buying fruit, veg or flowers wrapped in non‑recyclable plastic.  
- Check the recycle bin label—mine says *no plastic bags*.  
- Some stores used to charge for plastic bags; that scheme vanished quickly.  
- Reusable bags are good, but remember they’re still plastic and will eventually need disposal.  
- The only way to change this is for consumers to refuse the plastic offer.

## Reuse

Once we’ve used a product, we’re left with a container or package that is often recyclable **and** reusable.

### Ice‑Cream Container Shades

*You don’t eat ice‑cream?* No worries—someone else will have plenty.  
These containers are long‑lasting and can double as seedling shades:

- Cut out the top and place it over seedlings.  
- A stone on top keeps them from blowing away.  
- They allow airflow, protect from heavy rain, and shield seedlings from midday sun.  
- When seedlings are big enough, they can be removed.  
- Slugs and snails won’t shelter under them, but caterpillars can still find seedlings.

> **Tip:** Use a sturdy stone or small brick to keep the shade in place.

### Measuring Stick

All seed packets give row and plant spacing.  
Do you use a ruler, tape, or just guess?

- The photo shows measuring distance between rows (left) and between seeds (right).  
- I used leftover moulding wood (15 mm square, 70 cm long).  
- Cut grooves every 10 cm (and one at 15 cm).  
- Groove all sides; add numbers on one side with a wood‑burning tool for indelible marks.  
- Paint one end white for visibility.

> **Pro tip:** The same stick can also measure hole depth for plants or posts.

### Buckets

How much does the average household spend on plastic buckets each year?  
Buckets costing 50 c–$1 often break quickly.  
Better quality buckets last longer, but if a bucket splits or the handle falls off, the manufacturer likely won’t sell it again.

- The buckets above are close to indestructible, with a 20‑litre capacity.  
- Made from thick plastic that resists all liquids.  
- Features a removable bung for a small tap.  
- Handle is homemade from heavy wire and old garden hose, fitted to the U‑shaped base for easy pouring.  
- Reuse bottles that are clean and free of chemical residues.  
- Avoid bottles that once held farm poisons or industrial chemicals.  
- If the label is gone, discard it.

## Bird Dispersers

Birds are great for pest control and pollination, but some parrots love to raid fruit.

- I needed a cheap, repeatable, effective, easy‑to‑assemble deterrent.  
- The solution: **Wind‑spinners** made from two aluminium beverage cans.

**How to build:**

1. Cut the top off one can, snap off tabs, and place inside the whole can.  
2. Cut the can to form blades; fold out and give a slight twist (like propeller blades).  
3. Drill holes in both ends.  
4. Fit a length of wire, drill a hole in a stake, and attach the spinner.  
5. The spinner will spin, rattle, reflect light, and move with the wind—disrupting birds.  

> **Result:** Fruit losses dropped dramatically.  
> **Note:** Birds may get used to the spinners; deploy them just before fruit ripens.  
> **Maintenance:** If parts separate, a little glue fixes them.  
> **Consideration:** They’re noisy—make a few for neighbours.

## Plant Markers

Sometimes I plant a few seeds in an odd spot or raise seedlings for later transplanting.  
Without order, I can’t remember where each plant is.

- Reuse the bases of disused micro‑jet sprinklers or old garden lighting systems.  
- These markers are easy to place, remove, and don’t need to be perfect.  
- They’re reusable and save money.

## Dibbles

A dibble is a sharpened stick for poking holes in the ground.

- I made one from a broken axe handle—ideal for planting leeks.  
- A broken digging‑fork handle works too.  
- Cut, shape, oil, and you have a 62 cm dibble that saves bending.  
- I’ll make a longer one when I find something reusable.

## Fruit Fly & Insect Traps

Queensland fruit fly (QFF) is a major pest.  
Traditional control with dimethoate is no longer allowed for home gardeners.

**DIY trap:**

1. Use a 1.25‑liter beverage bottle.  
2. Drill holes in the cap, insert a lure wick, seal with hot glue.  
3. Create four 8 mm holes near the top and four near the middle for flies to enter.  
4. Brew your own attractant—gravy mix and water works well.  
5. Replace wicks cheaply; no need for commercial traps.
