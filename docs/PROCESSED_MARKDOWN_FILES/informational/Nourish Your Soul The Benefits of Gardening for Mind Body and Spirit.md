| **Digging & Lifting** | Upper‑body and grip strength | Enhances muscle tone and joint stability |
| **Weeding & Pruning** | Fine motor skills | Boosts dexterity and coordination |

**Key Takeaway:**  
- **Low‑impact, joint‑friendly** – perfect for those with arthritis or limited mobility.  
- **No special gear needed** – just a good pair of gloves and a sunny spot.
