*5 Learnings from a Greenhorne Green Thumb*  

Before you think, “There’s no way I can garden!” remember: if I can do it, **you totally can too**. We can start as novices, grow a garden revival, and maybe swap veggies one day.

## 1. Soil is the Foundation of Your Garden  

- **Think of soil as the house’s foundation**—the micro‑world where every plant’s life begins.  
- Healthy soil = **nutrients + microbes + bugs** working together.  
- Different plants need different soils:  
  - *Gravelly* for some, *lush, dense* for others.  
  - *Research* what you want to grow and match the soil.  
- **Save time and money** by buying bulk:  
  - Local landscape suppliers often sell high‑quality mushroom compost for **≈ $35 per half‑cubic metre** (almost a box trailer).  
  - Bunnings bags can cost *hundreds* for the same amount.  
  - Some suppliers even **lend box trailers for free** when you purchase from them.

## 2. Containers: Plants Will Grow Anywhere You Replicate Their Habitat  

- I’ve seen success in **old tea tins, baked‑bean jars, and even a stump** from my dad’s yard.  
- The key is to **mimic the plant’s natural conditions**.  
- If you’re short on time, choose hardy varieties like **succulents**—they need almost no care.  
  - *Lesson*: I watered a succulent daily and accidentally killed it with love.

## 3. Keep a Garden Journal  

- Garden lingo can be confusing, but a journal turns confusion into clarity.  
- Example entry:  
  > *“Entry 22: attempting to ‘thin seedlings’—did I mean to remove smaller ones to give the bigger ones room? It felt harsh, but the bigger seedlings thrived.”*  
- **Track what works** and what doesn’t; your notes become a personal reference guide.

## 4. Learn by Doing  

- Gardening is a craft—**hands‑on experience** is irreplaceable.  
- Expect challenges (e.g., green ants when pulling up runner grass), but the payoff is worth it.  
- **Resources**:  
  - Google & YouTube for quick answers.  
  - Talk to neighbors who are gardening enthusiasts; most love to share tips.  
  - If someone seems unfriendly, politely excuse yourself—your time is valuable.

## 5. Growing from Seed Is the Ultimate Reward  

- Seeds are **100 % cheaper** than nursery plants and offer far greater variety.  
- My approach:  
  1. **Quarter** of seeds in the chosen container.  
  2. **Quarter** in *jiffy peat discs* (great for a quick start).  
  3. **Half** saved for a backup if the first two fail.  
- *Tip*: Don’t try to plant 500 seeds in 36 peat discs—culling is inevitable and wasteful.

> **Take the leap**: make mistakes, record them, learn, and celebrate successes.  
> Watch a single pot plant multiply into a full‑blown vegetable patch.  
> The best advice? **Seek out gardening Yodas**—learn from their hard‑earned knowledge.  
> One day, you’ll be the one sharing that wisdom, and you’ll see a bit of your newbie self in the eager eyes of the next gardener.  

Until next time,  

\-Lozz.
