## About Turmeric  
*Curcuma longa* is a perennial plant in the ginger family, native to Southeast Asia.  
- **Ornamental**: bright green leaves and green‑cream flower spikes add a tropical vibe to gardens or courtyards.  
- **Edible**: the rhizomes—often called “fingers”—are 1.5 cm in diameter, rounder than ginger, and deep orange‑yellow thanks to curcumin.  
  - Curcumin is a bright yellow compound used as a flavouring, food colourant, and natural fabric dye.  

This guide covers how to grow turmeric, use it in cooking, dye food and fabric, and how to tackle its notorious stains.

## Turmeric in Cooking  

Turmeric rhizomes can be used **fresh** or **dried and ground** into a bright yellow‑orange powder.

### 1. What Does Turmeric Taste Like?  
- Warm, bitter, astringent, and peppery‑earthy.  
- Mustard‑like aroma.  
- *A little goes a long way*—it’s a strong spice that enhances other flavours.  
- **Pair with black pepper** to balance its astringency and add heat.

### 2. Fresh Turmeric  
- **Storage**:  
  - *Refrigerator*: paper bag, 2–3 weeks.  
  - *Freezer*: resealable plastic bag, up to 1 year.  
- **Handling tips**:  
  - Wear gloves or rinse hands immediately to avoid staining.  
  - Use a cutting board that’s easy to clean (glass or plastic).  
- **Substitution**:  
  - 1 tsp ground dried turmeric ≈ 2½ tsp fresh turmeric.  
  - Use **three times** more fresh turmeric than powder in recipes.

### 3. Dried Turmeric & Powder  
- Store in a cool, dark place.  
- **Shelf life**: loses pungency after ~1 year; buy in small batches or grind only what you’ll use in a few months.  

#### Turmeric Tea  
1. Stir ½ tsp ground turmeric into ½–1 tsp maple syrup or honey.  
2. Add 1 cup boiling water, a pinch of black pepper, and stir.  
3. Optional extras: ginger, lemon, or milk.  

#### Golden Milk (Haldi Doodh)  
| Ingredient | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| Milk (or plant‑based) | 2½ cups |
| Ground turmeric | ¾ tsp |
| Cardamom pods | 4 (crushed) |
| Ginger | ½ inch (thin slices) |
| Black peppercorns | 5–6 |
| Cinnamon stick | 1 inch |
| Sweetener (sugar, maple syrup, honey) | 1 tbsp (adjust) |
| Optional garnish | Cinnamon or cardamom powder |

**Method**  
1. Warm milk over medium heat.  
2. When lukewarm, add turmeric, cardamom, ginger, peppercorns, and cinnamon.  
3. Stir in sweetener, whisk, and simmer gently for 5 min (no boil).  
4. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit 5 min to deepen flavour.  
5. Strain into cups, sprinkle garnish, and serve hot.

## Colouring Food  

Both fresh and powdered turmeric are excellent natural colourants.

### Fresh Turmeric Paste  
1. Peel and chop a fresh root.  
2. Blend with a splash of water or grind with a mortar & pestle.  
3. Pass through a sieve; let sit 2–3 hrs to intensify colour.  
4. Add 2–3 tsp of paste to doughs or batters for a sunny yellow hue.

### Powdered Turmeric  
- **Direct use**: stir straight into food.  
- **Concentrated dye**: dissolve 1 tsp turmeric in ½ cup water, bring to a boil, reduce by half.  
  - Use a small amount for light yellow, more for deeper orange.

## Dyeing Fabric  

Turmeric is a *fugitive dye*: it sits on the fibre surface and fades over time (1 day–8 months).  

### Simple Dyeing Process  
1. Boil water in a pot large enough for the item.  
2. Add ¼ cup turmeric powder per tea towel (or adjust for larger pieces).  
3. Simmer 20 min.  
4. Dampen the item, submerge in the dye bath, keep heat low.  
5. Rinse, hang to dry.  

*Tip*: Use a glass or stainless‑steel pot to avoid lingering yellow stains.

## Stain‑Removal Tips  

Turmeric can stain almost anything—act fast!

| Surface | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| **Hands** | Wash immediately with soap & water; use a nail brush. Wear gloves if possible. |
| **Cutting Boards / Tools** | Rinse right away; wooden boards can be scrubbed with dish soap and air‑dry. |
| **Pots** | Stainless steel may show a yellow tinge; rinse promptly and wash. |
| **Countertops** | Wipe spills immediately; powder can stain surfaces. |
| **Clothing** | Wear an apron. If stained, rinse with cold water + detergent; avoid hot water. Use a stain remover if needed. |

**Remember**: The sooner you treat a turmeric stain, the higher the chance of complete removal.
