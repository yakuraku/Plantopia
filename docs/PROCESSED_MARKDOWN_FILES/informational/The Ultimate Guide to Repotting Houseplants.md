# The Ultimate Guide to Repotting Houseplants

## Why Repot?  

For a plant to thrive, its **soil volume and root space must match the size of its above‑ground growth**.  
When a plant outgrows its pot, it can become:

- **Water‑starved** – the soil dries out too quickly.  
- **Nutrient‑starved** – the potting mix loses fertility over time.  
- **Top‑heavy** – risking spills from furniture or shelves.  

Even if the plant still looks balanced, roots can **crowd the soil**, squeezing out the tiny air pockets that keep the mix moist and oxygenated. This can lead to:

- **Waterlogged soil** and root rot when drainage holes become blocked.  
- **Degraded potting mix** that no longer supplies essential nutrients.

## Does Your Plant Need Repotting?  

A good rule of thumb: **repot every 2–3 years** to refresh the mix.  
If you’re unsure, look for these signs:

1. **Roots bursting from the bottom** of the pot.  
2. A *flexible* plastic pot that **doesn’t give** when gently squeezed – the roots are packed tight.  
3. Watering feels ineffective; the soil stays **dry** despite regular watering.  
4. Water **runs straight off the sides** or out the bottom without soaking the mix.  
5. The plant looks **out of proportion** or top‑heavy.  
6. Growth has **slowed or stopped**, even in spring and summer.  

**Tip:** Gently lift the plant on its side and wiggle it out a bit. If you see roots circling or crowded, it’s time to repot.

## When to Repot  

The best window is during the **warmer months of spring and summer** when plants are actively growing. Repotting then lets them:

- **Adjust quickly** to their new pot.  
- **Recover faster** with less risk of root rot or disease.

## Repotting Step‑by‑Step  

1. **Gather supplies**  
   - New pot (size 1–2 inches larger in diameter)  
   - Fresh potting mix (with or without slow‑release fertilizer)  
   - Slow‑release fertilizer (optional)  
   - Clean secateurs  
   - Bucket or sink for soaking  
   - Watering can  

2. **Sanitize the pot**  
   - Scrub and sterilize any reused pot to prevent disease.  

3. **Enrich the mix** (if needed)  
   - Mix in slow‑release fertilizer at the recommended rate before use.  

4. **Remove the plant**  
   - Gently squeeze a flexible pot or use a knife to loosen the rootball.  
   - Soak the rootball for a few minutes if it’s stubborn.  
   - Shake off loose soil from around the roots.  

5. **Inspect and prune**  
   - Trim any dead, damaged, or circling roots.  
   - If staying in the same pot, prune about **one‑third** of the root volume.  

6. **Prepare the new pot**  
   - Add a thin layer of potting mix to the bottom—no pebbles or drainage aids needed.  

7. **Position the plant**  
   - Center it upright so the soil surface matches the previous pot’s level.  

8. **Add soil around the roots**  
   - Fill in gaps, tap the pot gently to settle the mix, and ensure no large air pockets remain.  

9. **Water thoroughly**  
   - Flush the soil, wash any residue off the leaves, and check the soil level.  
   - Top up if the mix has settled.  

10. **Post‑repot care**  
    - Inspect for pests, wipe leaves, prune dead foliage, and tidy the plant.  

**Recovery period:**  
- Allow **a few days to weeks** for the plant to adjust.  
- Keep the soil **moist but not soggy**.  
- **Avoid fertilizing** or over‑watering during this time.

### Quick Visual Checklist  
- **Rootball visible with roots spreading to the sides** – indicates a need for more space.  
- **Roots circling the pot** – prune to prevent “root‑bound” growth.  
- **Extra potting mix added to the top** – ensures the soil level stays consistent.  

By following these steps, you’ll give your houseplants the room, nutrients, and conditions they need to flourish—bringing healthier, happier greenery into your home for years to come.
