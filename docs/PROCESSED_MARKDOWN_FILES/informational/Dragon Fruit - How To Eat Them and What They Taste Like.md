## Where to Get Dragon Fruit

- **Grow it yourself**  
  *Start with a cutting or a small plant.*  
  Dragon fruit thrives in tropical or subtropical climates, but you can also grow it in a warm, sheltered greenhouse if you live in a cooler area.  
  *Look for well‑supported, mature plants that are already bearing fruit* – they’re ready for harvest!

- **Buy it ready‑to‑eat**  
  A quick trip to the grocery store or local market will usually yield a handful of fresh, ripe fruits.

## How to Choose Dragon Fruit

When you’re picking up your own or buying from the market, keep these pointers in mind:

- **Appearance**  
  *Bright, evenly coloured skin* (pink, red, or yellow) with well‑defined, evenly spaced scale‑like protrusions.  
  Avoid dull, faded fruit or pieces with too many spots, blemishes, or bruises.

- **Texture**  
  Gently press the fruit: it should feel firm but not rock‑hard.  
  A fruit that’s too soft or mushy is likely overripe.

- **Size**  
  Size isn’t a strict quality indicator; smaller varieties can be just as tasty as larger ones. Pick what fits your needs.

- **Variety**  
  *White‑fleshed* (pink or yellow skin) vs. *red‑fleshed* (red or pink skin) vs. *yellow* varieties.  
  Flavour and sweetness vary slightly—experiment to find your favourite.

- **Storage**  
  Fresh, ripe dragon fruit is best.  
  *Refrigerate* for a few days.  
  *Freeze* by peeling, cutting into small cubes, and laying them on a tray until solid. Then transfer to a sealed bag (remove excess air) for up to three months.

## What Does Dragon Fruit Taste Like?

A truly exotic bite!  
- **Flavor profile**: Think of a blend of kiwi, pear, and watermelon, with hints of citrus, berry, melon, lemonade, or coconut.  
- **White‑fleshed**: Mildest taste; seeds are so tiny you barely notice them.  
- **Red‑fleshed**: Fruitier, with a subtle sweet earthiness.  
- **Yellow**: Noticeably sweeter, with slightly crunchy seeds.

Overall, the fruit is mildly sweet with a creamy yet crunchy texture—some compare it to a pear, ranging from crisp to soft depending on ripeness.

## How To Prepare Dragon Fruit

1. Slice the fruit lengthwise.  
2. Use a spoon to separate the flesh from the skin.  
3. Slice, cube, or use a melon baller for fun shapes.

*Keep sliced fruit in an airtight container for up to one day.*  
If it starts to brown or turn mushy, compost it.
