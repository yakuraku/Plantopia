# Caring for Houseplants in Winter

30 August 2025

*Your indoor green friends need a little extra love when the temperature drops. Follow these practical steps to keep them thriving through the colder months.*

## Annual Growth Cycles

- Houseplants **do feel the seasons**. In winter they slow down, sometimes shedding a few lower leaves as a sign of preparing for cooler weather.  
- Shorter days and lower temperatures trigger this natural rest period.

## Position, Position, Position

- **Move your plants** to brighter spots: directly under a skylight or a sunny‑side window. Morning sun can even be fine for some species.  
- Avoid **cool drafts**: keep them away from old doors, leaky windows, and the cold gap between curtains/blinds and glass.  
- Likewise, steer clear of **hot air vents** from reverse‑cycle AC units or heaters that can dry out foliage.  
- If your plants spent the summer outdoors, bring them inside when nighttime temperatures fall below **12 °C**. Check for pests before the move.

## Winter Watering

- **Reduce watering frequency**. Plants use less water and evaporation is lower, so they need less moisture.  
- Signs of overwatering: constantly moist potting mix, fungus gnats, yellow or wilting leaves.  
- *Tip*: Water only when the surface feels dry to the touch, and use room‑temperature water to avoid shocking roots.

## Monitor for Pests and Diseases

- Lower light and reduced airflow make plants more vulnerable.  
- Overwatering creates a breeding ground for fungal infections.  
- Inspect regularly; treat problems early to keep your plants healthy.

## Preparing for Spring

- Once winter ends, **inspect** each plant: wipe leaves, prune dead parts, and top up potting mix.  
- Reverse winter adjustments: move plants out of direct sunlight and resume normal watering.  
- When nights warm, place struggling plants in a sheltered outdoor spot for fresh air.  
- This is the perfect time to **repot**, **fertilise**, and take cuttings—setting the stage for vigorous growth in spring and summer.

*Caring for houseplants over winter doesn’t have to be hard. By following these simple, actionable tips, you’ll keep your green companions happy and healthy all season long, and enjoy their beauty year‑round.*
