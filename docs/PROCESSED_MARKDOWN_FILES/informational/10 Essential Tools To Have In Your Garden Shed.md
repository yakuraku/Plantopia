30 August 2025  

Whether you’re just starting out or you’ve been pruning for years, having the right tools in your shed can turn a chore into a joy. Below is a practical guide to the must‑have items, why they matter, how to use them, and what to look for when you buy.

## 1. Gloves  
**Gloves** are the first line of defense for your hands. They keep dirt out, protect against sun, cuts, and thorns, and reduce the risk of infection.

- **Fit matters** – ill‑fitting gloves can cause blisters or slip off during work.  
- **Types & uses**  
  - *Lightweight cotton* – perfect for potting and light tasks; offers sun protection.  
  - *Leather* – durable for heavy work like pruning or moving stones.  
  - *Coated* – breathable fabric with a latex or similar coating; great for weeding or potting because of good grip and cut resistance.  
  - *Reusable or disposable nitrile/latex/vinyl* – snug fit for seedling work; lets you feel what you’re doing while staying protected.  

**Browse gloves** – coated, leather, cotton, nitrile.

## 2. Spade  
A spade is more than a simple shovel. Choosing the right one saves effort and improves precision.

- **Shapes & purposes**  
  - *Shovel* – angled head, ideal for digging shallow holes and moving soil.  
  - *Spade* – square, sharp cutting edge; perfect for precise holes, cutting through compacted soil, and edging beds.  
- **Handle length & material** – long handles for reach; wooden or steel handles; blades are usually stainless or carbon steel.  
- **Practical tip** – a top‑of‑the‑line stainless steel spade may feel great in the shop, but if it’s too heavy, you’ll tire quickly in the garden. Pick a weight you can manage for repeated use.

## 3. Fork  
A sturdy garden fork is essential for cultivating and breaking up compacted soil.

- **Tines** – 4–5 tines, straight or slightly curved.  
  - *Straight square tines* – stronger, ideal for digging into hard soil.  
  - *Curved tines* – better for scooping mulch and turning compost.  
- **Construction** – all‑steel or a combination of wood and steel.

## 4. Rake  
Rakes come in two main varieties, each with a distinct role.

- **Grass rake** – fan‑shaped head (plastic or metal); gathers leaves and clippings into a pile.  
- **Landscape rake** – robust metal head with short, solid tines; spreads and levels soil or sand, especially before sowing seeds.

## 5. Hand Trowel  
The hand trowel is a small spade that’s indispensable for tight spaces.

- **Uses** – digging small holes, planting seeds, working in planter boxes, containers, and pots.  

**Browse hand trowels**.

## 6. Hand Fork  
Like a trowel, a hand fork loosens small patches of soil.

- **Functions** – prepares soil for planting and loosens soil around weeds for easier removal.

**Browse hand forks**.

## 7. Weeder  
A weeder completes the trio of essential hand tools.

- **Design** – two‑pronged, rust‑resistant stainless steel with a wooden handle.  
- **How it works** – digs under a weed, then lever it out with roots intact.  
- **Alternatives** –  
  - *Weeding knives* – great for weeds between pavers or under rocks.  
  - *Hand‑held hoes* – push or drag the head at a shallow angle to cut stems or dislodge smaller weeds.  
  - *Dutch hoe* – shallow angled blade; sweeps across soil to slice weed tops.  
  - *Draw hoe* – wide blade set at right angles; pulled toward you to cut weeds.

## 8. Secateurs  
Secateurs are the gardener’s scissors and are often the most used tool after gloves.

- **Types**  
  - *Bypass secateurs* – scissors‑like, two blades that pass next to each other; ideal for thin, young stems and fresh green growth.  
  - *Anvil secateurs* – blades do not overlap; act like a knife on a chopping board; best for thicker branches or dead wood.  
  - *Lightweight snips* – perfect for deadheading flowers and harvesting veggies or fruit.  
- **Choosing the right pair** – look for comfort, balance, and sharpness.  
- **Maintenance** – clean, sharpen, and adjust blades regularly to extend life.

**Browse secateurs and snips** – anvil, bypass, and regular types.

## 9. Watering Can  
After planting, watering is crucial for establishment and long‑term health.

- **Design** – portable container with a spout; some have a rose (perforated funnel) to slow flow and prevent splash‑out.  
- **Materials** –  
  - *Plastic* – lightweight, available in many shapes and sizes.  
  - *Galvanised metal* – heavier but more durable and long‑lasting.  

**Browse watering cans**.

## 10. Wheelbarrow, Bucket, or Trug  
Moving soil, mulch, and clippings efficiently keeps your garden tidy.

- **Wheelbarrow** – ideal for larger gardens; single‑wheel or two‑wheel models for stability on rough terrain.  
- **Bucket** – plastic or metal; plastic is cheap but fragile; metal is sturdier and safer in bushfire‑prone areas.  
- **Trug** – traditionally a shallow wooden basket; now also a large plastic tub with handles; larger than a bucket, great for collecting clippings, water, or tools.

**Browse buckets and trugs** – useful for carrying, shifting, and moving things around the garden.
