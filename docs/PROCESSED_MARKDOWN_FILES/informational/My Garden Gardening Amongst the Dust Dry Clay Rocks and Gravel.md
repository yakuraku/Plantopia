**30 August 2025**

## A Quick Walk Through My Central Victoria Garden  
Shelana takes us on a tour of her 7‑acre property, revealing the challenges of **dusty, dry, clay‑laden soil** and offering practical tips for turning a tough site into a thriving garden.

## 1. Back to the Roots – Why the Change?  
- **Returned after 5 years in the city** – ready to transform the land.  
- **Two‑and‑a‑half years of hard work**: pulling, pruning, chopping, mulching, and clearing over‑grown trees and shrubs.  
- The soil is a **gardener’s nightmare**: rocks, gravel, clay, and *bone‑dry* conditions (except for a rare drizzle).  

Because of this, the garden’s vision shifted from “normal” flower beds to **drought‑tolerant, hardy species**.

## 2. Planting Strategy in Tough Soil  
### 2.1. Preparing the Ground  
- **Crowbar is your best friend** – used to dig 12 holes in the orchard, 6 in the citrus plot, and dozens for native trees.  
- **Add a soil amendment** before planting:  
  1. Sprinkle a handful of **Gypsum** (clay breaker).  
  2. Fill with **horse manure** (plenty of it!).  
  3. Cover with the excavated dirt and let sit **2–3 weeks**.  

### 2.2. Fruit Trees  
- **Remove all dirt from the roots** before planting.  
- For bare‑root trees:  
  1. Take out of packaging.  
  2. Rinse roots.  
  3. Place in a large container with **liquid fertilizer** (e.g., Seasol tonic + Power Feed).  
  4. Let soak **3–4 days** before transplanting.  

### 2.3. Heat Management  
- **Plan to paint trunks white** next summer to reflect heat.  
- **Citrus trees**:  
  - Often re‑pot to protect from 35–40 °C heat and dry winds.  
  - Replaced with **Salvias** and **Buddlejas** when moved.

## 3. Raised Beds & Summer Crops  
- **6 metal raised beds** – will be swapped for **straw bales** to keep soil cooler.  
- **Summer crop performance**:  
  - *Capsicums, Chilli, Eggplants* thrive.  
  - *Tomatoes* underperformed this year.  

### 3.1. Shade & Heat Protection  
- Two **shade cloth roller blinds** are no longer needed – *waste not, want not*.

## 4. Fertilizing with Horse Manure  
- **Liquid manure**:  
  1. Place two timber stakes on top of a 20 L plastic bin.  
  2. Fill a large pot with horse manure.  
  3. Put the pot on the stakes and run water through until the bin is full.  
  4. Add this liquid each time you water the veg garden – *no risk of overflow*.  

- **Compost**: add manure directly to compost piles for a steady nutrient supply.

## 5. Native and Other Plantings  
- **Acacias**: Pycnantha (Golden Wattle), Baileyana (Golden Mimosa), Black Mimosa, Purple‑leaf Acacia.  
- **Hakeas**: 2 Pin‑Cushion varieties.  
- **Flowering gums**:  
  - 80‑plus‑year gum tree (branches trimmed to reduce weight).  
  - 150‑plus‑year gum tree.  
- **Other species**:  
  - *Calistemon*  
  - Native grasses (for wild ducks)  
  - Silver Princess *Eucalyptus*  
  - Paulownias  
  - Schinus *Molle* (Peppercorn tree)  
  - Pink Ribbon *Eucalyptus* (weeping variety)

## 6. Quick Tips & Tricks  
- **Crowbar digging** saves time and effort in rocky soil.  
- **Gypsum + manure** combo breaks up clay and enriches the soil.  
- **Liquid fertilizer soak** gives bare‑root trees a head start.  
- **White trunk paint** keeps trees cooler in extreme heat.  
- **Shade cloth** is handy for unexpected heat spikes.  
- **Horse manure** is a versatile, free resource for both compost and liquid feed.
