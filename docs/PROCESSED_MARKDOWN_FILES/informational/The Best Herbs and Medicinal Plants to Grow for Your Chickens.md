## How Variety Helps Your Chickens' Health  

Even the most productive garden can’t replace a **high‑quality base feed** that supplies protein and balanced nutrition. Still, adding a handful of specific herbs and veggies can boost your flock in three key ways:

- **Nutrient boost** – fresh plants bring a wider range of vitamins and minerals, supporting healthier, higher‑yielding layers.  
- **Natural pest control** – many herbs deter insects or can be mixed into feed to keep pests at bay.  
- **Enriched lives** – a varied diet keeps chickens curious, happier, and easier to care for.

## Two Important Points to Consider  

1. **Start small** – when introducing a new plant or treatment, give your birds only a *tiny amount* at first. Chickens can react unpredictably, so watch for any positive or negative changes before scaling up.  
2. **Choose the right spot** – chickens love to peck, so place treats **near the run but out of reach** (e.g., on a raised planter) or grow them inside the run in a **cage that limits pecking to outer leaves**.

## Favourite Herbs and Plants to Grow for Your Chooks  

Experimentation is part of the fun, but here are the most popular choices and the benefits they’re often credited with:

### 1. Oregano, Parsley, and Sage  

- **Fast growers** that produce abundant leaves.  
- Add fresh leaves in season, or dry larger harvests for later use in feed.  
- **Nutritious** and packed with antioxidants that boost immunity.  
- *Oregano* is studied for its natural antibiotic and anti‑parasitic properties.  
- *Sage* may help reduce salmonella risk (though it shouldn’t replace standard safety practices).  

### 2. Thyme  

- Grows more slowly; keep it **out of reach** if you want it to thrive.  
- The woody stems make excellent nesting material, offering antibacterial benefits and helping repel insects.  

### 3. Calendula (Pot Marigold)  

- Bright orange flowers that double as a natural food coloring.  
- Sprinkle a few petals into feed each time you top it up to encourage **richer yolk color**.  

### 4. Comfrey  

- A perennial that improves soil quality.  
- Low in fiber, high in protein and nutrients—great for a chicken’s diet.  
- Contains allantoin, useful for treating dry or irritated skin, and may enhance yolk color.  
- Feed fresh or dried leaves, or grow it beside the coop so chickens can nibble on outer leaves without destroying the plant.  

### 5. Mint  

- Powerful aroma drives away flies, mosquitoes, and even rodents.  
- Hang fresh or dried bunches around the run for insect control.  
- Add a splash of mint to drinking water for a **cooling effect** on hot days (see garlic section for dosage tips).  

### 6. Lavender  

- Known for its calming scent in humans; chickens seem to enjoy it too.  
- Cut stems after flowering and hang fresh or dried around the coop, or mix into nesting material.  
- The fragrance keeps chickens relaxed, reduces quarrels, and can make the coop area less odorous for neighbors.  

### 7. Garlic  

- Antibacterial, antifungal, and believed to support immunity, circulation, and digestion.  
- **Water infusion**: add one fresh clove per litre of drinking water; replace both water and garlic every 48 hours to avoid rancidity.  
- Watch for aversion—if chickens avoid the water, try adding one crushed clove to the feed once a week (be mindful of potential flavor changes in eggs).  
- **Kitchen scraps**: keep skins and stalks; place them in nesting boxes to deter mites.
