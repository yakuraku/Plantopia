## Why Make a Bird‑Friendly Garden?

Birds are the unsung heroes of a healthy garden ecosystem.  
- **Pollination** – They help flowers set seed.  
- **Pest control** – They keep insect numbers in check.  
- **Soil enrichment** – Their droppings add nutrients.  

With habitat loss on the rise, suburban gardens become *stepping stones* that link parks and bushland, offering refuge, food, and water. Even if birds don’t nest there, they’ll visit for a quick snack or drink. Watching their playful interactions and listening to their chatter turns your yard into a living, breathing symphony.

## The Three Essentials

Creating a bird‑friendly garden boils down to **food, shelter, and water**. Even a tiny courtyard can attract feathered friends if you focus on these three pillars.

### 1. Food

Choose plants that provide nectar, insects, fruit, or seeds. Different birds have different tastes:

| Bird | Feeding Style | Favorite Plants |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Honeyeaters** | Tongue‑dip into flowers for nectar, then hunt insects for protein | Grevilleas, kangaroo paw, eucalyptus, waratah |
| **Parrots** | Hooked beaks grab flowers, seeds, and grubs | Eucalyptus, banksia, lilies, grasses |
| **Carnivorous birds** (kookaburras, butcher birds, currawongs) | Hunt insects, worms, lizards, frogs | *Not plantable*, but encourage by leaving leaf litter, avoiding chemicals, and providing ground‑level water |

**Tips:**
- Plant *native* species that thrive locally; they’re a natural food source for native birds.  
- Mix natives with exotic flowers to keep the garden stylish without limiting bird options.  
- Avoid fruit or berry plants that can become invasive; birds may spread their seeds far beyond your garden.  
- Refrain from feeding birds with commercial seeds or other food – it can create dependency and alter natural behavior.

### 2. Shelter

Birds need safe havens from predators and larger “bullying” species.

- **Dense, prickly shrubs** (e.g., mountain currant, gold dust wattle) create cozy refuges for small birds.  
- **Layered vegetation** – grasses, small and medium shrubs, and trees – supports both large and small species.  
- **Tree hollows** are essential for parrots, owls, and other cavity nesters. If mature trees are scarce, install **nest boxes** that match local species’ size and shape, and place them high enough to keep cats out of reach.

### 3. Water

A clean, reliable water source is a major attraction.

- Set up at least **one bird bath** on a pedestal near protective shrubs.  
- Position it away from cat‑hot spots and near a high structure so birds can keep watch for predators.  
- Keep the bath **shallow** (not deep) so birds can wash, preen, and drink comfortably.  
- Clean and refill regularly – birds learn to rely on dependable water.

## Other Considerations

To truly support avian life, adopt these practices:

- **Go chemical‑free** – encourage beneficial insects and avoid chemicals that travel up the food chain.  
- **Keep cats indoors** – they’re a major nighttime threat to birds.  
- **Protect productive plants** – use wildlife‑friendly netting or fruit protection bags on fruit trees and veggie beds, and check them often to ensure proper installation.

By thoughtfully selecting native plants, providing reliable water, and creating safe shelter, you’ll build a thriving ecosystem that delights both you and the birds that visit.
