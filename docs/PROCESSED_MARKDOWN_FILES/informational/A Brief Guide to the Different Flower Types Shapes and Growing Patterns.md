## 1) Flower Shapes  

Flowers are broadly divided into two families: **rounded, symmetrical** forms and **tube‑like** forms with irregular petal placement.  
Below are the most common shapes you’ll encounter:

| Shape | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Cross‑Shaped (cruciform)** | Four petals, one at each compass point. |
| **Star‑Shaped (stellate)** | Petals radiate outward like a star. |
| **Saucer‑Shaped** | Broad petals close together, forming a shallow bowl. |
| **Cup‑Shaped** | A deeper saucer, with a more pronounced rim. |
| **Bell‑Shaped (campanulate)** | Deep, narrow bowl; petals splay outward at the tips. |
| **Tubular** | A closed bell‑shaped flower that forms a long, tight tube. |
| **Funnel‑Shaped** | A looser tube; petals fan slightly outward. |
| **Pitcher‑Shaped** | Wide, rounded base tapering to a cone‑like top. |
| **Trumpet‑Shaped** | Tight funnel at the bottom, petals open gently from halfway up. |
| **Salverform** | An extreme trumpet: petals spread at right angles from halfway up, giving an open, round‑faced display. |
| **Rosette** | Several rows of tightly packed flowers arranged in whorls or circles. |
| **Pompom** | A rosette taken to extremes; rows curl backward to form a dome or ball. |
| **Pea‑Like** | Unsymmetrical: one large upper petal, two medium side petals, and either two small petals or a fused pair at the bottom. |
| **Slipper‑Shaped** | Irregular pouch‑like shape with long petals. |

*Practical tip:* When selecting seeds, match the flower shape to the pollinators you want. Bell‑shaped flowers are great for bees, while tubular forms attract hummingbirds.

## 2) Petal Arrangements  

Wildflowers usually have simple petal layouts, but cultivated varieties often feature more elaborate arrangements. The six main types are:

- **Single** – One row of relatively flat petals.  
- **Recurved** – Petals curve backward and upward, exposing stamens.  
- **Reflexed** – Similar to recurved, but petals point more sharply backward.  
- **Semi‑Double** – Two or three rows, forming a typical rose shape.  
- **Double** – Multiple rows create a tight, multi‑layered circle; stamens are usually hidden.  
- **Fully Double** – A dense dome or ball of petals, often with no visible stamens.  

*Practical tip:* Double or fully double flowers are ideal for cut‑flower arrangements because they hold their shape well after cutting.

## 3) Flower Inflorescence  

Not every plant bears a single flower on a single stem. The grouping of flowers is called an **inflorescence**. Common types include:

- **Solitary** – One flower per stalk.  
- **Cluster** – Multiple flowers on unbranched stalks, all from the same stem point.  
- **Umbel** – A bowl‑like cluster; all stalks radiate from a single point at the stem tip.  
- **Flowerhead** – Many miniature, stalkless florets packed across a flattened disc or pad.  
- **Raceme** – A main stem with side‑stalks, each bearing a single flower.  
- **Cyme** – Stems with side‑stalks that hold several flowers each.  
- **Spike** – Stalkless flowers radiate around a single stem, densely packed.  
- **Corymb** – A dome or flat‑topped cluster of single‑flowered stalks from different stem parts.  
- **Panicle** – The most complex: several sets of racemes, cymes, or corymbs branching from a central stem.  

*Practical tip:* Plants with umbels (e.g., carrots, dill) are excellent for attracting a wide range of pollinators, while spikes (e.g., lilies) provide a dramatic vertical display.

## 4) Flower Habits  

A flower’s **habit** describes how it hangs from its stalk. Habits can change as the flower matures, so mature habit is usually the reference point.

- **Erect** – Petals and other parts point straight upward.  
- **Horizontal** – The flower points sideways at a right angle from the stem.  
- **Nodding** – Loosely downward from an upright stem that bends under its own weight.  
- **Pendent** – The entire flower hangs vertically downward from a horizontal or downward‑pointing stem.  

*Practical tip:* Pendent flowers (e.g., orchids) often need support in the garden to prevent drooping and to keep them visible to pollinators.

## 5) Flower Colour Types  

Flower colours can be grouped into four broad categories, each with distinct patterns:

- **Self‑Coloured** – A single, uniform colour across all petals.  
- **Bicoloured** – Two distinct colours in the same petal, separated by a clear line between base and tip.  
- **Picotee** – A variant of bicoloured: the petal edge is a different colour, with a sharp dividing line.  
- **Striped** – Two colours arranged in stripes along the petal’s length.  

*Practical tip:* Bicoloured and picotee flowers are eye‑catching in borders, while striped varieties add visual interest to mixed beds.

Even the simplest flower can possess its own beauty, but as complexity increases, accurate description becomes essential. These technical terms give you a precise language to identify, select, and care for any flower—wild or cultivated.
