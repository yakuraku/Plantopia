## Why Australia Loves Dogs (and Gardens)

Australia is a nation of dog lovers—**over 60 % of households own a pooch**.  
Dogs bring joy, companionship, and a touch of wildness to any yard, but their love of digging, playing, and guarding can clash with a tidy garden.  
Let’s explore how to balance your dog’s needs with a space that’s welcoming for you and your guests.

## 1. Understand Your Dog’s Behaviour  

- **Observe first**: Every dog patrols fences and loves to explore lawns, but some *dig more*, *track through grass*, or *lie on plants* than others.  
- **Breed & personality matter**: A terrier may dig relentlessly, while a retriever might just lounge.  
- **Use these insights** when planning layout, plant placement, and fencing.

## 2. Fencing: Your Dog’s Secure Haven  

- **Solid fences win**: They keep dogs in and intruders out, and give dogs a clear boundary to patrol.  
- **Create a “dog run”**: Leave a mulched strip between fences, hedges, or screening trees for a safe play zone.  
- **Plant wisely**:  
  - *Avoid thorny or spiky plants* that could hurt paws.  
  - *Skip delicate species* that will be trampled.

## 3. Basic Needs: Shade, Water & Shelter  

| Need | What to Do | Why It Matters |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Shade** | Identify the *shadiest* spots in summer and the *sunniest* in winter. | Keeps your dog cool in heat and warm in cold. |
| **Water** | Provide fresh, clean water at all times. | Hydration is essential, especially after play. |
| **Bird‑friendly** | Place bird baths/ feeders high enough for birds to feel safe. | Encourages wildlife without risking your dog’s safety. |
| **Shelter** | Add a kennel or covered outdoor area for rain or when you’re away. | Protects your dog from the elements. |
| **Toileting area** | Train your dog to a specific spot; use mulch or gravel. | Keeps the rest of the garden clean and human‑friendly. |
| **Maintenance** | Pick up waste promptly. | Prevents odors and keeps the yard hygienic. |

## 4. Lawn Care: Letting Your Dog Play Without the Damage  

- **Distraction works**: Toys, long walks, and engaging activities can reduce constant patrolling.  
- **Accept some wear**: Fencing off a worn patch often just moves the problem.  
- **Choose resilient grass**:  
  - *Buffalo grass* spreads by rhizomes and regrows over bare patches.  
- **Dog urine**:  
  - High nitrogen can burn grass, leaving yellowed spots.  
  - *Practical fix*: Water the lawn immediately after urination (not always feasible).  
  - *Better solution*: Provide a dedicated urination area or add a “dog rock” product to your dog’s water.

## 5. Protecting Garden Beds  

- **Low hedges**: Act as a gentle deterrent against digging.  
- **Spiky plants**: Place at the front of borders to discourage pawing.  
- **Raised beds or containers**: Ideal for plants that are especially vulnerable or for dogs that dig relentlessly.

## 6. Toxic Plants: Keep Your Pooch Safe  

- **Common culprits**:  
  - *Flowering bulbs*  
  - *Lilies*  
  - *Foxglove*  
  - *Cycads*  
  - *Oleander*  
  - *Rhododendrons*  
  - *Azaleas*  
- **Why it matters**: These can provoke serious reactions or even be fatal.  
- **If you suspect poisoning**:  
  - Call your vet immediately.  
  - Bring a sample of the consumed plant.

## 7. Chemicals & Compost: Going Green  

- **Prefer organic, chemical‑free methods** for the health of you, your dog, and the planet.  
- **When sprays are necessary**:  
  - Target the area precisely.  
  - Fence off or net the sprayed zone for a few days afterward.  
- **Dog waste & compost**:  
  - *Avoid adding waste* to compost; it may contain worm‑treatment chemicals.  
  - If you do, **don’t use finished compost on edible plants**.  
  - Remember, worms dislike dog poo, so it may linger in the final product.
