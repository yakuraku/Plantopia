# About Our Paper Seed Packets  

**30 August 2025**

We’re **very excited** to introduce you to our new paper seed packets.  
These packets are not only recyclable, but they also come with **more planting information** and a handy **QR code** that puts everything you need right at your fingertips.

## Why the switch?

- Our old **soft‑plastic packets** provided ideal conditions for seed storage, but many of you are looking for a **plastic‑free** option.  
- We’ve spent time finding packaging that is **paper‑based, recyclable, and still offers the quality** needed for good seed storage.  
- The new packets are a little **larger and easier to open** than the old ones. They can be **cut or torn open** and then **folded over** to keep unsown seeds safe.

## Rolling out the change

- To minimise waste, we’ll introduce the new seed packets **gradually over a 6‑12‑month period**.  
- During this time you may receive a **mix of old and new packets** in your orders.  
- Rest assured that **all the seeds we sell are of the highest quality** and that we **regularly test** them to meet our high standards.
