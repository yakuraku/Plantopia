## Why Colour Matters in Your Garden  

*Colour isn’t just decoration – it’s the mood‑setter of your outdoor space.*  
- **Cool hues** (blues, mauves, greens) bring *restfulness* and *calm*.  
- **Warm hues** (yellows, reds, oranges) inject *energy*, *movement* and *happiness*.  
- Mixing both gives a vibrant, balanced feel that keeps the garden lively.  

A monochromatic scheme can feel *curated* or *modern* depending on the shapes and shades you choose. Pick flowers in varying tones of a single colour and pair them with different textures to keep the design alive.

## The Colour Wheel – Your Design Blueprint  

The wheel is built on the primary colours **red, yellow, and blue**.  
- **Complementary colours** sit opposite each other; they clash beautifully and create high impact.  
- **Harmonious colours** sit next to one another; use them in threes—one dominant, two accents.  
- **Neutral colours** (white, black, grey, silver, brown, green) tie everything together and can be used without altering the overall feel.

## Cool Colours & Flower Choices  

| Colour | Flower Examples | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **Blue** | *Nigella, borage, cornflower, nemesia, delphinium, forget‑me‑not, veronica, lobelia, larkspur, ageratum, salvia, felicia* | True blue is rare, but these give a full spectrum. |
| **Mauve/Purple** | *Violas, lavender, sweet peas, nigella, lobelia, ageratum* | Adds depth without being too bright. |
| **Green** | *Various foliage and silvery‑leafed plants* | Acts as a natural neutral and buffer. |
| **Pale Pastels** (cool) | *Pale pink zinnia, dianthus, stock, sweetpea, petunia, rose paper daisy, snapdragon, cosmos* | Soft pinks that still feel cool. |
| **Pale Yellow** | *Carnation ‘Lemon Fizz’, Zinnia ‘Isabellina’, Nasturtium ‘Peach Melba’, Aster ‘Benary’s Princess Yellow’, French marigold ‘Lemon Drop’, Cosmos ‘Xanthos’* | Adds a gentle warmth while staying cool. |
| **White** | *Alyssum, armeria, candytuft, Shasta daisy, gypsophila, chrysanthemum, cosmos, stock, Queen Anne’s lace* | Highlights and offsets other colours. |

*Tip:* Pair a dominant cool colour with a few warm accents to keep the garden from feeling too monochrome.

## Practical Steps to Build Your Cool‑Colour Garden  

1. **Choose a dominant cool hue** (e.g., blue or mauve).  
2. **Add complementary accents** in pale yellow or pink to create subtle contrast.  
3. **Use neutrals** (white, grey, green) for borders, mulch, or structural plants.  
4. **Vary plant heights and textures** to add depth—tall delphiniums, mid‑height lobelia, ground‑cover alyssum.  
5. **Incorporate vegetables** for extra colour: *silvery cabbage leaves, purple artichoke buds* fit perfectly into a cool palette.
