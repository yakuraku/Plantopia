**Use your site to the best Advantage!**  

Below are a few practical tips, ideas and suggestions on how to make the most of specific areas in your garden:

---

## 1. Walls & Fences  

- **Brick or concrete wall**  
  *Provides wind protection and stores heat.*  
  • Helps crops ripen earlier  
  • Extends the growing season into autumn  

- **Fence**  
  *Offers a sturdy support for climbing plants.*  
  • Ideal for beans, peas, and “staking” tomatoes  

---

## 2. Window Boxes  

- Place a window box outside a **north‑ or east‑facing** window.  
  • Plant herbs, flowers, or small vegetables that thrive in cooler light.

## 3. Extra Creative Uses  

- **Carport wire + climbing beans**  
  *Creates summer shade for your car* **and** a natural screen from neighbours.  

- **Leaky gutter or downpipe**  
  *Collects extra water* for thirsty veggies like rhubarb or sweet corn—whether on your house or a neighbour’s shed.  

- **Stacking plants**  
  *A clever way to fit more food into a small space.*  
  *(More on this later __)*

## 4. Explore Your Site  

Take a few minutes for a “time‑out” walk around your garden.  
- Identify **warm spots**, **cool spots**, **damp spots**, **shady spots**, and **drier spots**.  
- Every niche can grow something—why not something to eat?  

Enjoy turning every corner into a productive, delightful part of your garden!
