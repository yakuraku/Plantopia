*Complete Guide to Maintaining Your Garden Tools*

Garden tools are the backbone of every garden. From shovels and rakes to secateurs and motorised equipment like hedge trimmers or lawnmowers, each tool has a specialised purpose that makes gardening easier and more enjoyable. When they’re old, worn, or dull, however, they can turn a pleasant task into a frustrating chore.  

Let’s walk through how to keep your tools clean, oiled, and sharp so they stay in peak performance.

## The Benefits of Looking After Your Garden Tools

Keeping hand tools (shovels, pruners, snippers, hoes, rakes) and power tools (chainsaws, hedge trimmers, weed eaters) clean, sharp, and well‑maintained offers many advantages:

- **Plant Hygiene** – Cleaning and disinfecting prevents the spread of disease.
- **Safety** – Sharp tools are easier to use and less likely to slip and cause injury.
- **Clean Pruning** – Cuts from sharp secateurs heal faster and look better.
- **Rust‑Free** – Clean, dry tools are less prone to rust.
- **Longevity** – Proper care can make tools last for years, even generations.
- **Enjoyment** – Working with well‑maintained tools makes gardening more fun and encourages you to tackle tasks.

## Seasonal Tool Maintenance

A simple routine of wiping tools clean and storing them properly can keep them in great shape, but the real magic happens when you:

- **Clean when dirty or dull**  
- **Maintain throughout the growing season**  
- **Store in autumn**  
- **After working with contaminated plants or soil**  
- **After using tools in someone else’s garden** (to avoid spreading weeds and disease)

## How to Care for Hand Tools

Hand tools are essential for keeping your garden thriving. Follow these steps each season to keep them in top condition.

### 1. Remove Dirt and Debris

Removing mud, organic matter, and grit prevents scratches, moisture retention, and rust.

- **Spray** with a garden hose.  
- **Soak** in a bucket of soapy water (dish soap works fine).  
- **Scrape** with a metal scraper (old putty knife or stiff wire brush).  
  *Work carefully to avoid damaging sharpened edges.*

### 2. Remove Sticky Residue

Sap, grease, or other build‑ups can blunt edges or jam mechanisms.

- **Rubbing alcohol** (isopropyl) removes most residues.  
- **Orange oil** or commercial degreasers work well too.  
- **Lighter fluid** is effective but must be handled with extreme caution.

### 3. Disinfect

Soap alone may not kill pathogens, especially after working with diseased plants.

- Rub tools with **70 % rubbing alcohol** or an alcohol‑based sanitiser.  
- **Caution:** Bleach can corrode metal and dull edges, so avoid it for routine sanitising.

### 4. Dry Before Storing

Wet tools rust; damp handles mould.

- **Towel‑dry** or let them sit in the hot sun until completely dry before storage.

### 5. Rust Removal and Prevention

Even well‑cared tools can rust.  

- **Scour** rusted surfaces with steel wool or a stiff wire brush.  
- **Oil** the cleaned metal to protect it.  
  *Recommended natural oils:*  
  - Linseed oil  
  - Tung oil  
  - Mineral oil  
  - Coconut oil  

  *Avoid motor oil* – it introduces unwanted chemicals into the soil.

**TIP:** For a quick daily routine, fill a 20 L bucket with sand and a splash of oil. After each use, dip the working heads of your tools into the sand to clean and oil simultaneously.

### 6. Protect Wooden Tools and Handles

Wooden handles can crack, splinter, or rot without care.

- **Sand** rough or splintered spots.  
- Rub in the same oils used for metal to keep the wood smooth and protected.

### 7. Sharpening

Sharp tools are safer and easier to use.  

- **Small tools** (secateurs, snippers) – use a whetstone, fine‑grit sharpening stone, or specialised sharpener.  
- **Large tools** (axes, shovels, mower blades) – use a mill/bastard file or electric grinder.

**Sharpening steps:**

1. Wear **PPE** (gloves, eye protection).  
2. **Wet** the stone to reduce friction.  
3. Align the stone with the blade’s bevel.  
4. Slide the blade along the stone with a slight sweeping motion (push or pull).  
5. Repeat on both sides until a sharp edge is achieved.

## Looking After Power Tools

Power tools—mowers, weed eaters, hedge trimmers, chainsaws—require a slightly different routine.

1. **Unplug** or disable the tool before servicing.  
2. **Clear vents** of debris that can restrict airflow and cause overheating.  
3. **Tighten** mounting screws that may loosen over time.  
4. **Sharpen or replace** removable blades or lines as needed; some tools should be sharpened by a professional.  
5. **Wipe** the machine to remove plant matter.  
6. **Lubricate** and add oil per the manufacturer’s instructions.  
7. **Service regularly** to extend lifespan.  
   - If you’re uncomfortable with small‑engine maintenance, many shops offer affordable servicing.

## Storing Garden Equipment

Proper storage protects tools from the elements and keeps them ready for use.

- Store in a **clean, dry** place: a purpose‑built shed, garage, greenhouse corner, or any dry spot.  
- Use **shelves or tool racks** for smaller items; line up or hang larger tools on the wall.  
- Keep tools **out of reach of children** and secure them to prevent falling hazards.  
- **Hang larger tools** to save space and keep them off the floor.

**Even the most rusty, dull tool can be reinvigorated and returned to its former glory.** By following these simple steps throughout the growing season, you’ll keep your secateurs, snips, spades, forks, and rakes clean and ready for the next job, and your power tools in good working order. The result? Longer‑lasting tools and a more enjoyable gardening experience.
