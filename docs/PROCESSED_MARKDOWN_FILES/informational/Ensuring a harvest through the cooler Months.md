## 1. Carrots: Leave Them in the Ground  

- **Pull the last carrots in late winter** – otherwise they’ll sprout again, grow woody, and become inedible.  
- *Tip:* Keep the roots in the soil until you’re ready; they’ll stay fresh longer.

## 2. Indoor Sprouts & Microgreens  

- Grow them **anytime of year**—they’re perfect for salads, stir‑fries, and sandwiches.  
- *Pro:* They’re quick to harvest and add a fresh crunch to any dish.

## 3. Late‑Autumn Tomatoes  

- Leave unripe tomatoes on the bush.  
- When the plant is ready, **pull it up and hang it by the roots** in a shed or similar space.  
- The tomatoes will continue to ripen, extending your harvest season.

## 4. Staggered Plantings  

- **Smaller plantings or sowing every couple of weeks** keep the yield steady and avoid a glut.  
- If you still have excess, preserve it by:
  - Freezing
  - Bottling
  - Drying

## 5. Harvesting Early  

- Start picking vegetables as soon as they’re ready.  
- **Carrot thinnings** become tasty “baby” carrots.  
- **Outer leaves of lettuce or cabbage** can be used immediately—just take what you need.
