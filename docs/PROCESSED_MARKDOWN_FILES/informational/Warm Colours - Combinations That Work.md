## Why Warm Colours Matter  
Warm hues—**red, orange, and yellow**—naturally lift our mood and energise a space. Just like cool blues or purples, they can *transform* the feel of your garden.  

- **Pollinator magnet**: Birds love bright reds, while butterflies are drawn to reds, pinks, and yellows.  
- **Design impact**: Warm tones add cheerfulness, movement, and a sense of liveliness.  

Use them wisely to attract wildlife *and* create a vibrant, welcoming design.

## How Warm Colours Affect Your Garden  

| Situation | Effect | Tips |
|-----------|--------|------|
| **Large spaces** | Bright warm colours *open up* the area, drawing the eye | Use bold reds, oranges, yellows to create focal points |
| **Small spaces (courtyards, beds)** | Too many bright hues can feel *crowded* | Stick to **paler shades** (peach, apricot, cream) for warmth without dominance |
| **Busy gardens** | Excessive pops can *overwhelm* | Balance bright colors with neutral tones (white, cream, grey, brown, green) to calm the eye |
| **Cool‑tone schemes** | Warm hues can *warm up* blues, greens, and purples | Pair lemon‑yellow or golden‑yellow with blue, add a touch of white or cream for balance |

## Design Ideas

### 1. Monochromatic Warm Palette  
Choose **one** warm colour and vary its shades and flower shapes.  
- **Avoid monoculture** by mixing textures and sizes.  
- Example: A garden of **red** blooms ranging from bright poppies to deep burgundy salvia.

### 2. Mixed Warm Palette  
Blend bright and pale shades to keep the design lively yet harmonious.  
- **Bright**: Scarlet zinnias, orange marigolds.  
- **Pale**: Peach nasturtiums, cream‑tinted calendula.

### 3. Neutral Balancing  
Incorporate neutrals to anchor the design.  
- **White/cream**: Softens intensity.  
- **Grey/brown**: Adds depth.  
- **Green**: Acts as a natural backdrop.
