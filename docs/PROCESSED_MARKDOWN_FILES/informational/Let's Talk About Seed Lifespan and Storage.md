# Seed Lifespan & Storage Guide

## Why Storage Matters  
Once you’ve received your seeds, you’ll want to keep them **viable** until you’re ready to sow.  
- **Heat, moisture, humidity, and light** all speed up seed decay.  
- Even seeds with a *best‑before* date can lose germination power if stored poorly.

## How Long Do Seeds Stay Fresh?  

| Lifespan | Typical Seeds |  
|----------|---------------|  
| **Short‑lived (1–2 yrs)** | Angelica, Caraway, Chives, Corn, Fennel, Leek, Okra, Onion, Parsley, Parsnip, Perilla, Rhubarb, Salsify |  
| **Medium‑lived (3–4 yrs)** | Alfalfa, Artichoke, Asparagus, Basil, Bean, Beet, Brassica, Carrots, Chard, Dill, Lavender, Lemongrass, Mustard, Oregano, Pea, Pumpkin, Sorrel, Thyme, Tomato |  
| **Long‑lived (5+ yrs)** | Celery, Chicory, Cucumber, Eggplant, Endive, Kale, Lettuce, Radish, Rocket (Arugula), Rockmelon, Strawberry, Turnip, Watercress, Watermelon |  

> **Tip:** Even if a seed packet says “best before,” it may still germinate well past that date—just make sure it’s stored correctly.

## Optimal Storage Conditions  

1. **Cool & Dark**  
   - Store in a refrigerator (not freezer).  
   - Temperature: *above freezing* but *cold enough* to slow metabolism.  

2. **Dry & Airtight**  
   - Use a sealed packet inside an airtight container (Tupperware, mason jar, etc.).  
   - Add a **silica gel sachet** or a few grains of **dried rice** to absorb excess moisture.  

3. **Temperature‑Controlled Retail**  
   - When buying, check that the seed has been stored in a climate‑controlled environment.  
   - Avoid seeds that have sat on a shelf near a heating vent or in a sunny kitchen bench.  

4. **Pre‑Use Handling**  
   - Let seeds **warm to room temperature** before opening the container to prevent condensation.

## Practical Storage Checklist  

- [ ] **Seal** seeds in a tight‑lidded container.  
- [ ] Add a **silica gel packet** or **dried rice**.  
- [ ] Keep in the **fridge** (not freezer).  
- [ ] Avoid **hot** or **sun‑lit** spots (e.g., tin shed, glasshouse).  
- [ ] When ready to sow, **bring to room temp** first.

## When to Refresh Your Seed Stock  

| Seed Type | Refresh Interval |  
|-----------|------------------|  
| Short‑lived | Every **12 months** |  
| Medium‑lived | Every **24 months** |  
| Long‑lived | Every **60 months** |  

> **Pro tip:** If you’re unsure, test a handful of seeds before planting to confirm viability.

## Bottom Line  
Storing seeds properly is the key to a successful garden next season.  
- Keep them **cool, dry, and dark**.  
- Use airtight containers with a moisture‑absorbing sachet.  
- Replace or test seeds according to their lifespan.  

Happy sowing!
