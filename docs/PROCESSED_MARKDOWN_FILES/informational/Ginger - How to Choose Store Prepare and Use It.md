## Choosing or Selecting Ginger

- **Look for plump, firm pieces** – avoid shriveled or fibrous roots.  
- **Decide the age**  
  - *Older roots*: woodier, stronger, hotter flavor.  
  - *Younger roots*: tender, sweeter, light flavor that deepens with age.

|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Room temperature** | Keep unpeeled in a cool, dry spot. | 1–2 weeks |
| **Refrigerator** | Place in an airtight container or sealed bag. | > 1 month |

> *Tip:* Keep the skin on to preserve moisture and flavor.

### 2. Long‑Term Storage

| Method | Steps | Duration |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Freezing** | • Peel (optional for organic). <br>• Wash, dry, and air‑dry. <br>• Store whole or cut into pieces in sealed plastic bags. <br>• *Alternative:* Puree in a food processor, freeze in ice‑cube trays, then transfer to a bag. | Up to 6 months |
| **Pickling** | • Slice thinly. <br>• Salt, let sit 30 min, squeeze excess liquid. <br>• Heat vinegar, water, sugar until sugar dissolves, then boil. <br>• Pour over ginger, cool 5 min, seal. <br>• Refrigerate 24 h before use. | 1 month |
| **Candied/Crystallized** | • Simmer slices in sugar syrup. <br>• Cool, coat with sugar crystals, air‑dry. | Use in desserts, granola, ice cream |
| **Drying** | • Peel (optional). <br>• Thinly slice. <br>• Air‑dry or use dehydrator/oven at 100 °C until brittle (2–4 h). <br>• Store airtight, grind as needed. | Freshly ground: 2 months; dried: 6 months |

> *Note:* Pickled ginger may appear pink due to natural pigments or added beet juice.

## Working With Ginger

### 1. Peeling and Washing

- **Tools:** sharp knife, vegetable peeler, or a teaspoon.  
- *Teaspoon trick:* Scrape the edge over the surface; the skin comes off easily.  
- For older roots, a knife or peeler works best.  
- If you prefer not to peel, wash or scrub thoroughly—especially if the ginger is organically grown.

### 2. Slicing & Dicing

- **Thin slivers:** Use a sharp knife, peeler, or mandolin (hand guard on).  
- **Julienne strips:** Slice thinly against the grain, stack slices, then slice again.  
- **Mincing:** Turn julienne strips 45° and chop finely.

### 3. Grating & Pureeing

- **Grating:** Fine grater or microplane; frozen pieces grate without thawing.  
- **Pureeing:** Peel, chop, crush in a mortar & pestle with a pinch of salt, or mash grated ginger with a spoon.

### 4. Drying (for Powder)

1. Peel (optional) and thinly slice.  
2. Arrange a single layer on a wire rack.  
3. Air‑dry or use a dehydrator/oven at 100 °C (2–4 h).  
4. Store airtight; grind in a spice or coffee grinder as needed.

## Using Ginger

- **Fresh ginger** brightens teas, stir‑fries, curries, and sauces.  
- **Dried ginger powder** is spicier and more potent; ideal for baked goods, spice blends, and savory dishes.  
- **Pickled ginger** cleanses the palate (sushi) or adds a sweet‑spicy kick to salads and poke bowls.  
- **Candied ginger** is perfect for desserts, granola, or ice‑cream toppings.  
- **Dried ginger powder** pairs well with cardamom, nutmeg, and cinnamon in sweet or savory recipes.
