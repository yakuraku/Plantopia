## Why Perennials Are a Game‑Changer

- **Low‑maintenance**: Plant once, harvest for years.  
- **Hardy**: Many survive frost, snow, and drought (just water during extreme dry spells).  
- **Pest‑resistant**: Rarely need pesticides.  
- **Versatile**: From kitchen herbs to ornamental accents, they fit any yard.

## 1. Herbs That Keep on Giving

| Herb | Key Traits | Practical Tips |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Rosemary** | *Perennial*, can reach 3–4 ft, piney‑citrus flavor, excellent for landscapes and bouquets | • Plant in well‑drained soil.<br>• Trim regularly to keep size manageable.<br>• Harvest before flowering for best taste. |
| **Thyme** | *Perennial*, smaller than rosemary, piney flavor, purple flowers | • Works well in borders or rock gardens.<br>• Harvest before flowers for sweeter leaves. |
| **Oregano** | *Perennial*, slightly less hardy, citrus‑y notes | • Needs a bit more moisture than rosemary/thyme.<br>• Harvest before flowering to avoid bitterness. |

> **Harvesting Tip**  
> Cut herbs in the morning after the dew has dried. Store in a glass jar with a little water, cover loosely, and keep in the fridge for up to a week.  
> For long‑term storage, freeze in butter or oil in an ice‑cube tray—perfect for quick flavor boosts.

## 2. Perennial Vegetables That Demand Less Work

### Onions, Leeks & Garlic  
- **Family**: All are perennials and among the hardiest edible plants.  
- **Growth**: Thrive in shaded forests or open meadows.  
- **Maintenance**:  
  - *Plant once* and let them multiply.  
  - *Never harvest all bulbs*—leave some to spread naturally.  

### Asparagus & Artichokes  
- **Asparagus**  
  - *Growth*: Spreads each year; harvest shoots, leaving the crown intact.  
  - *Low effort*: No need to dig up the soil each season.  
- **Artichokes**  
  - *Growth*: Harvest the bud, and the plant regrows.  
  - *Ideal for the less‑motivated gardener* who still wants fresh produce.  

### Berries  
- **Blackberries, Raspberries, Blueberries**  
  - *Hardiness*: Very resilient, can survive harsh winters.  
  - *Space*: Grow large; transplant if they outgrow their spot.  

> **Space Planning**  
> Allow at least 2–3 ft between asparagus crowns and 3–4 ft between berry canes to give them room to flourish.
