## A Rich History: From Aztecs to Cottage Gardens

The story of Four O’Clocks is as fascinating as the plant itself.

- **Aztec Roots** – The Aztecs were among the first to cultivate this wonder, using it for both medicinal and ornamental purposes. Its origin earned it the alternative name *Marvel of Peru*.  
  - *Root*: valued as an aphrodisiac and hallucinogen.  
  - *Leaves*: used for wound healing.  
  - *Flowers*: source of red food colouring.

- **16th‑Century Exploration** – Explorers brought Four O’Clocks to Europe, where it quickly gained popularity for its ornamental value.  
  - The evening‑opening flowers and delightful fragrance earned it the French name **Belle de Nuit** (*Beauty of the Night*).

- **19th‑Century Australia** – Mirabilis was a popular ornamental plant in southeastern Australia, fitting easily into cottage gardens and thriving in hot summers.  
  - Its rapid spread and easy cultivation earned criticism; an 1883 article in the *Adelaide Advertiser* called the plant “too vulgar to be tolerated in a genteel garden”.

## Growing Four O’Clocks: Tips and Tricks

### 1. Start From Seed

- **When to Sow**  
  - *Cool/temperate climates*: spring.  
  - *Warmer regions*: March to September.  
- **Preparation**  
  - Some gardeners soak seeds overnight for faster germination.  
- **Planting Depth & Temperature**  
  - Sow 2 cm deep.  
  - Germination occurs in 7–14 days at 20–22 °C.

### 2. Transplanting

- Wait until **after the last frost** before moving seedlings outdoors.  
- *Tip*: Don’t plant them out before your tomatoes!

### 3. Care & Maintenance

- **Light** – Full sun or part shade.  
  - Leaves may wilt during the day but revive when temperatures cool at night.  
- **Water** – Keep soil consistently moist; well‑watered plants produce the best blooms.  
- **Pinching** – Pinch young stems to encourage denser growth.  
- **Deadheading** – Flowers do not self‑shed. Removing spent blooms keeps the plant tidy and promotes continuous flowering.

### 4. Managing Spread

- **Local Weediness** – Shoots can sprout from the large, persistent tap root.  
- **Self‑seeding** – Plants will readily self‑seed; seeds usually drop near the parent plant.  
- **Control** – Container growing or regular removal of unwanted seedlings and suckers is advisable.
