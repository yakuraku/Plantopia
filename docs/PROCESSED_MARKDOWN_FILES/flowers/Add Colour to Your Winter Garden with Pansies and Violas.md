# Add Colour to Your Winter Garden with Pansies and Violas

*30 August 2025 – *Add Colour to Your Winter Garden with Pansies and Violas*

Both pansies and violas belong to the violet family (**Violaceae**). Technically they’re perennials, but most gardeners grow them as **annuals** because they either die back or become straggly after flowering.

Recent breeding has blurred the line between the two. Some growers judge by flower size, petal arrangement, or markings.  
- **Pansies** (*Viola wittrockiana*) → larger, velvety blooms, often with contrasting blotches or “eyes.”  
- **Violas** (*Viola cornuta*) → smaller, mounding plants with dainty flowers.  
- **Johnny jump‑ups / heartsease** (*Viola cornuta* or *Viola tricolour*) → delicate, small blooms in purple, yellow, and white. Their name comes from their easy self‑seeding habit.

In Scandinavian folklore, pansies were called “stepmother” flowers because the petal arrangement resembles a family: the large lower petal is the stepmother, the two large upper petals are her daughters, and the smaller upper petals are the step‑daughters. More often, people see faces, whiskers, or wings in the petals—whimsical “cat‑like” lines radiating from the centre. Whatever you spot, the cheerful blooms spark imagination.

## Sowing the Seed

| Climate | Timing | Light | Depth | Spacing |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|---------|
| Cool/temperate | Late summer to autumn **or** early spring (cold climates) | **Dark** – cover seeds to exclude light | 6 mm | 15 cm – 30 cm apart |

**Tips:**
- **Cover seeds** with soil or a black board/black plastic to keep them dark. Remove the cover once sprouts appear.
- Germination takes **≤ 1 week** at 17–21 °C.
- Transplant seedlings when they have their first true leaves and are 8–12 weeks old.
- For **annuals** in full sun, plant in a sunny spot; in warm climates or spring plant in part shade, avoiding afternoon sun.

## Cultivation

- **Soil:** Moist, rich, well‑draining.  
- **Fertiliser:** A soluble feed encourages more blooms.  
- **Pests:** Aphids and slugs love them—watch and treat promptly.  
- **Mould & mildew:** Often caused by damp soil or too much shade. Move pots to a sunnier spot if outbreaks occur.  
- **Deadheading:** Removes spent flowers, extending the blooming period.  
- **Light pruning:** After the first flush, trim lightly to prevent legginess.  
- **Heat sensitivity:** They may die back in summer, which is why they’re usually grown as annuals.

## Saving Pansy & Viola Seeds

1. Let flowers fade; petals shrivel and die.  
2. A swollen seed pod forms, dries, and splits into three segments.  
3. Collect the small, round seeds.  
4. Store them for next season **or** leave them in situ to self‑seed.

## Pansies & Violas in the Garden

- **Containers:** Perfect for adding winter colour; their cheerful faces thrive in small pots or hanging baskets.  
- **Edible companion:** They’re edible—great for filling gaps in a vegetable garden.  
- **Mass plantings:** Ideal for edging paths or creating a vibrant border.

## Pansies & Violas in the Kitchen

- **Edible flowers** can be frozen in ice cubes, tossed into salads, or used as garnishes on cakes and pastries.  
- **Pressing or crystallising** turns them into decorative cake accents.  
- **Harvesting:** Avoid chemicals. Pick early in the morning when flowers are well‑hydrated. Regular harvesting encourages continuous blooming.  
- **Storage:** Keep in the fridge for a few days. Place on a damp paper towel in an airtight container; check daily to remove wilted blooms.
