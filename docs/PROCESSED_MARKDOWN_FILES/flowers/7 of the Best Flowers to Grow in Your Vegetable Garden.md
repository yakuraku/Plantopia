## Why Add Flowers to Your Veggie Patch?

Many gardeners hesitate to give up space for “unproductive” plants, but **flowers bring real value** to a vegetable garden:

- **Pollination boost** – Bees, wasps, and butterflies love bright blooms, and they’ll visit your veggies for a tasty reward.
- **Natural pest control** – Beneficial insects such as ladybirds, lacewings, and hoverflies are attracted to certain flowers, feeding on aphids and caterpillars.
- **Aromatic deterrents** – Some flowers release scents that repel pests, acting as a natural pesticide.
- **Trap crops** – Flowers like nasturtiums lure pests away from your main crops, allowing you to remove the “sacrificial” plant before damage spreads.
- **Bonus harvests** – Edible petals, leaves, and seeds add culinary flair to salads, desserts, and snacks.
- **Aesthetic charm** – A splash of color, fragrance, and cut‑flower potential turns a plain bed into a lively, inviting space.

## Where to Plant Flowers

| Strategy | How it Works | Tips |
|----------|--------------|------|
| **Interplanting** | Mix flowers directly with veggies. | Keeps beneficial insects close and confuses pests. |
| **Border planting** | Line the edges of beds with flowers. | Creates a natural “fence” of blooms. |
| **Pollinator rows** | Plant a dedicated row of flowers between veggie rows. | Maximizes pollinator traffic. |
| **Edge spill‑over** | Grow low‑to‑ground flowers (e.g., nasturtium, alyssum) that spill over the sides. | Adds beauty without cutting into crop space. |
| **Vertical space** | Use fences, arches, trellises, or hanging baskets. | Ideal for limited‑area gardens. |
