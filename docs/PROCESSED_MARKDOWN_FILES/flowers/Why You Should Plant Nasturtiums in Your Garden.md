30 August 2025  

Enjoy the beauty and benefits of nasturtiums by adding them to your garden. These **pretty, hardy plants** are not only a splash of color but also **edible, low‑maintenance, and a fantastic companion plant** for vegetables, roses, and more.

## Versatile & Easy to Grow  

- **Thrives in poor soil** – actually blooms more in nutrient‑poor soil than in rich, heavily fertilized beds.  
- **Variety of growth habits** – choose from bushy, climbing, or cascading types.  
- **Color palette** – blooms range from white, orange, red, yellow, to maroon.  
- **Dwarf varieties** – perfect for containers or tight spaces.  
- **Low care** – germinates easily and needs minimal attention, making it ideal for beginners.

## Fully Edible  

All parts of the plant are edible and packed with flavor and nutrients:

- **Leaves, flowers, and seeds** are safe to eat and rich in **vitamin C**.  
- **Flowers** have a peppery bite—great for adding a punch to salads, sandwiches, or a colorful garnish.  
- **Leaves** are milder but still peppery; toss them into salads, stir‑fries, pesto, soups, or casseroles.  
- **Leaf‑stuffing ideas** – fill with chicken or tuna salad, roll up for a low‑carb snack or entrée.  
- **Seeds** resemble capers in taste and texture.  
  - *Capers‑like substitute*: harvest green seeds, wash, and soak in vinegar for 3 days (prick with a fork first to help the vinegar penetrate).  
  - *Seasoning*: roast dried seeds in the oven; use whole as peppercorn substitutes or grind for a pepper‑free spice blend.

## Companion Plants  

Nasturtiums are a **win‑win** for your garden:

- **Attracts beneficial insects** – ladybugs, hoverflies, and other aphid‑predators flock to them.  
- **Sacrificial crop** – aphids prefer nasturtiums, sparing your more valuable plants.  
- **Pollinator magnet** – the bright flowers lure bees, butterflies, and other pollinators.  
- **Easy pest management** – once aphids gather on nasturtiums, they’re easier to control or harvest.

## How to Grow Nasturtiums  

1. **Self‑seeding** – nasturtiums will return year after year.  
2. **Planting time** – sow seeds directly in a sunny or partially shaded spot during spring or summer.  
3. **Seed prep** – large seeds are kid‑friendly; soak overnight or nick the seed coat to speed germination.  
4. **Watering** – keep soil moist until seedlings emerge; thereafter, they’re drought tolerant.  
5. **Maintenance** – minimal watering and weeding; let them flourish and enjoy the vibrant blooms.

Give nasturtiums a try—**inexpensive, easy to find, and full of garden and culinary perks**.
