# How to Grow Lilies

*30 August 2025 – *How to Grow Lilies*

Few flowers bring as much beauty to a summer garden as lilies. While many garden plants are known by the common name “lily,” true lilies belong to the genus **_Lilium_**. Growing from a scaly bulb, lilies are upright perennials that reach **70 cm to 180 cm** tall, with narrow leaves and beautifully scented trumpet‑like blooms. They *star in the heat of summer* and also make long‑lasting cut flowers. Grow them in clumps between other plants or group them in large containers where their scent and colour can be enjoyed.

Varieties are available that can thrive in all Australian climates, from tropical to cool. So long as their basic soil conditions are respected, lilies are easy to care for and flowers will return year after year with a blaze of summer colour. Here’s what you need to know to add this elegantly impressive flower to your perennial garden.

## Position & Soil Preparation

- **Sunlight**  
  - Full sun *or* part shade.  
  - In cool or warm temperate regions, choose a spot with **morning sun** but protection from strong afternoon sun.  
  - In hotter climates, plant in dappled shade or a spot with just a few hours of morning sun.  
  - If afternoon sun is unavoidable, *increase watering* to keep the soil from drying out, which can quickly cause wilting.

- **Root temperature**  
  - Lilies prefer **cool roots**.  
  - Plant them beneath shrubs or between groundcover plants to give them the conditions they love.  
  - If that’s not possible, apply a thick layer of organic mulch to keep the roots cool.

- **Watering**  
  - Lilies are reasonably drought tolerant once established, but **regular watering during the growing season** helps them establish.  
  - Very moist conditions can lead to bulb rot.  
  - If your garden is prone to waterlogging, consider growing lilies in raised beds, mounded‑up borders, containers, or in parts of the landscape with a natural slope.

- **Soil pH**  
  - Lilies do best in soil with a slightly acidic pH of **5.5 – 6.5**, making them ideal partners for azaleas and camellias.

## Planting Your Lily Bulbs

- **Timing**  
  - Plant bulbs from **early winter through to early spring** to give them time to establish roots before the growing season starts in earnest.  
  - Fresh, green bulbs (not dormant) should be planted *as soon as possible* after arrival. Don’t let them dry out.

- **Spacing & Depth**  
  - In flowerbeds, plant bulbs **20 – 40 cm apart**.  
  - Dig to a depth of **10 – 20 cm** (roughly twice the bulb’s size).  
  - For clumps, dig one large hole, spread the bulbs at the recommended spacing, then backfill.

- **Mulching & Fertilising**  
  - Mulch with compost or well‑rotted cow manure.  
  - Sprinkle over a slow‑release fertiliser or blood and bone to give a good start.

- **Container Growing**  
  - Lilies thrive in large containers if spaced about **10 cm apart** and planted **15 cm deep**.  
  - When growing several plants in one pot, position the bulbs so they’re all pointing slightly inward toward each other, allowing stems to support one another.  
  - Use a potting mix enriched with a slow‑release fertiliser, or add extra feed to a standard mix.  
  - After planting, add a dry mulch over the top to keep the soil cool; shoots should appear in **1 – 3 weeks**.

## Ongoing Care and Cultivation

- **Watering**  
  - Once shoots emerge, water deeply **once or twice a week**.  
  - Add a liquid feed when the first buds start to form.  
  - Continue this schedule until flowering is over.

- **Post‑Flowering**  
  - Remove fading flower heads and apply another feed to help shore up the bulbs for the next season.  
  - Leave as much leafy stem behind as possible; only cut the plant back completely once the stems have died off. This allows the bulbs to replenish their nutritional supplies.

- **Clump Management**  
  - Over time, lily bulbs will multiply to form natural clumps.  
  - After **3 – 4 years**, clumps can become overcrowded and flowering will suffer.  
  - To avoid this, lift the bulbs in late autumn, separate the new bulblets growing around the main bulb, move the individual bulblets to a new position, and replant the main bulbs in their original spot.

## Common Pests & Diseases

| Problem | What to Watch For | Quick Fix |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Slugs & Snails** | Fresh lily shoots | Use standard spring precautions (traps, barriers) |
| **Aphids** | Small, soft‑bodied insects on leaves | Spray a mix of water and horticultural soap |
| **Fungal Issues** | Especially in humid climates or overcrowded clumps | Ensure proper spacing, divide clumps every few years |

With a huge array of plant heights, flower types, and colours to choose from, it’s well worth adding lilies to the “must grow” list for your garden.
