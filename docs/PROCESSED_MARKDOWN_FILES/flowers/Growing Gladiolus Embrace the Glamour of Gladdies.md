# Growing Gladiolus: Embrace the Glamour of Gladdies!

**30 August 2025**  
*Gladiolus*, affectionately called **“glads”** or **“gladdies,”** once carried a reputation for being garish or funerary. It’s time to give these flamboyant flowers a fresh, modern makeover. With their tall spikes of vibrant blooms, gladiolus adds a splash of extravagant glamour to any garden or vase.

## Gladioli or Gladiolus?

- **Gladiolus** is the botanical genus and belongs to the iris family.  
- **Gladioli** is simply the plural form—more than one gladiolus plant.  
- Origin: Europe, the Mediterranean, Western Asia, and Africa.  
- Modern hybrids result from cross‑breeding Mediterranean and South African species, producing the large‑flowered *Gladiolus grandiflorus*, the most common garden variety today.

## Bulb or Corm?

- Gladiolus actually grows from **corms**—thickened underground stems that store food.  
- Corms are round and flattened, resembling mini berets.  
- Each year a fresh new corm forms on top of the old one; the old corm is replaced by a new shoot the following season.  
- **Cormels** (small corms around the base) can be separated and planted to create new plants.  
  - *Tip:* Cormels usually need 2–3 years to grow large enough to flower.

## Gladiolus in the Garden

- **Perennial** with tall, one‑sided flower spikes, each bearing many individual flowers (florets).  
- Color range: single hues, bicolored combinations, plain, wavy, or ruffled petals.  
- Leaves: upright, long, pointed—earning the nickname **“sword lilies.”**  
- **Garden uses:**  
  - Fill gaps and weave between shrubs and perennials.  
  - Add height and a vertical element to mixed borders and cottage gardens.  
- **Planting tips:**  
  - **Clumps:** at least 5 corms per clump.  
  - **Drifts:** scatter randomly between established perennials and small shrubs.  
- **Container options:**  
  - Taller varieties suit large containers.  
  - Smaller species (naturalising, cottage, or baby gladioli) are perfect for courtyards or small gardens; they’re often scented and dainty.

## 5 Top Tips for Growing Gladdies

### 1. Planting Time

| Climate | Best Planting Window | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|-------|
| Tropical | Year‑round | |
| Warm temperate / subtropical (frost‑free) | **June – mid‑September** | Gives corms time to establish before summer. |
| Cold climates | **August – September** | Avoids frost damage. |
| **Succession planting** | Every 3–4 weeks | Keeps a continuous display of blooms. |

### 2. Staking and Support

- Gladiolus stems are tall and delicate; strong winds can damage them.  
- **Plant in a sheltered spot** to reduce wind stress.  
- **Mound soil** around stems as they grow; this provides natural support.  
- For taller stems, use **thin bamboo canes** hidden behind the flowers.  
  - Tie with a soft tie every 20 cm.  
- **Tip:** Staking early prevents bending and keeps the spikes upright.

### 3. Cutting Flowers

- Florets open from the bottom of the spike upward.  
- **Harvest** when the lowest floret has just started to open.  
  - This allows remaining buds to continue blooming, extending the display.

### 4. Caring for Cut Flowers

- Some florists prune the tip of the spike to encourage lower blooms.  
  - *Pros:* Keeps stems upright.  
  - *Cons:* Reduces the airy movement of the stems.  
- As upper florets open, lower ones fade.  
  - **Pinch out** spent florets to keep stems looking fresh longer.

### 5. Lifting Corms

- **Frost‑free climates:** Leave corms in place; they will naturalise and add color year after year.  
- **Mild frost climates:** Apply a thick mulch layer in winter to protect corms; they can stay in the ground.  
- **Frosty cold climates:** Lift corms for safekeeping.  
  - **Procedure:**  
    1. Dig up corms.  
    2. Let them cure on a wire rack or crate outside for ~2 weeks.  
    3. Discard old, shriveled corms; keep fresh, plump ones for planting.  
    4. Optionally divide and plant cormels—just be patient; they mature slowly.
