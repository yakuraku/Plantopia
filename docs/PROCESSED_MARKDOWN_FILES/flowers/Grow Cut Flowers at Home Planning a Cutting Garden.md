# Grow Cut Flowers at Home: Planning a Cutting Garden  
==============================  
30 August 2025  

The way flowers are grown specifically for cutting is a little different from most plants.  
**Cut‑flower plants need long stems**, so they’re often planted close together to encourage upright growth.  
They may be **staked, netted, or corralled** into a small space, and a *succession* of annuals keeps the garden from going bare.

Just like with vegetables, careful planning ensures a steady supply of blooms from **spring to autumn** and avoids a glut of any single variety.

## 1. Identify Your Growing Area  

- **Sunlight**: Aim for **at least 6 h of direct sun** per day.  
  - A little late‑afternoon shade is fine and can protect delicate blooms.  
  - Most cut‑flower plants simply won’t thrive in shade.  
- **Orientation**: Beds that run **north‑south** receive the most light.  
- **Shape & Size**:  
  - Don’t feel limited to rectangular beds.  
  - **Circular beds** work well—plant the tallest flowers in the centre.  
  - Raised beds, pots, or containers are also suitable.

## 2. Mark Out Your Beds  

1. **Define the space**:  
   - Use stakes at each corner to outline beds.  
   - Beds should be **90–120 cm wide** and as long as practical.  
   - Leave narrow paths if you have multiple beds.  
2. **Support & Protection**:  
   - Stakes can hold **netting or twine** to guide stems upright.  
   - They’re also handy for **shadecloth** or **frost covers** if needed.  
3. **Preparation**:  
   - Thoroughly weed the area.  
   - Enrich the soil with **compost or aged manure** before planting.

## 3. Choose Your Plants  

- **Variety matters**:  
  - Pick flowers you love, but aim for a mix of **feature flowers, fillers, and foliage**.  
  - Decide on a colour theme (warm or cool) or go for a vibrant mix.  
- **Plant types**:  
  - *Cut‑and‑come‑again* crops: cosmos, zinnia.  
  - *One‑off* bloomers: single‑stem sunflowers.  
  - Include **early, mid‑season, and late** annuals, bulbs, biennials, and perennials.  
  - Add **fillers** such as feverfew, baby’s breath, Queen Anne’s Lace, and soapwort.  
  - For larger spaces, consider shrubs for foliage.  
- **Record details**:  
  - Height, recommended spacing, and *days to maturity* for each plant.

## 4. Make a Plan  

1. **Sketch the bed**:  
   - Draw a paper plan to scale on graph paper.  
   - Calculate how many of each variety fit.  
2. **Group by size**:  
   - **Small** (20 cm spacing): dianthus, zinnia, snapdragons, ageratum, soapwort, spring‑flowering bulbs.  
   - **Medium** (30 cm spacing): celosia, Bells of Ireland, gypsophila, small chrysanthemums.  
   - **Large** (45–60 cm spacing): sunflowers, large chrysanthemums, perennials.  
3. **Placement strategy**:  
   - Place **tallest plants to the south** of the bed so they don’t shade shorter ones.  
   - Use **twine or netting** between corner stakes to keep stems upright.

## 5. Plan for the Whole Season  

- **Succession planting** keeps the garden blooming steadily.  
  - Stagger sowing by **2–4 week intervals**.  
  - This avoids a burst of early flowers followed by a long wait.  
- **Seedling prep**:  
  - Raise seedlings in punnets, soil pellets, or trays.  
  - This frees up bed space for mature plants.  
- **Continuous harvest**:  
  - When a plant passes its peak, replace it with a new seedling to maintain productivity.

## 6. Keep a Journal  

- Record:  
  - What you planted, when, and when the first flowers appeared.  
  - Whether the effort was worth it.  
  - Any plants that outperformed or underperformed.  
  - Unusual weather, pest, or disease issues.  
- Even a simple list of varieties with planting and harvest dates is invaluable for next season’s planning.

By following these steps, you’ll create a **productive, year‑long cutting garden** that delivers fresh blooms for every occasion.
