============================

## 1. When to Cut

- **Cut before the bloom fully opens** for the longest vase life.  
  - *Roses, cosmos, delphiniums, and snapdragons* keep blooming after cutting.  
  - **Cut these when the buds start to open**—just the first few petals unfurling.  
- **Wait until near full bloom** for flowers that won’t open much more after picking.  
  - *Dahlias* and *Queen Anne’s Lace* fall into this category.

## 2. Clean Your Tools

Bacteria shortens vase life by rotting stem ends.  
**Disinfect every tool and container**:

| Item | Cleaning Method |
|------|-----------------|
| Snips, scissors, secateurs | 10 % bleach solution (1 part bleach : 9 parts water) **or** rubbing alcohol **or** tea tree oil |
| Bucket | Soapy water, rinse thoroughly **or** 10 % bleach solution |
| Vase | Dishwashing detergent **or** 10 % bleach solution |

> *Tip:* If you’re unsure, always go with the bleach solution—it’s the most reliable.

## 3. Cut Early or Late

- **Morning**: before the sun hits the petals.  
- **Late afternoon**: when the air is cooler.  

These times keep the flowers from being stressed by heat or dehydration.

## 4. Take a Bucket With You

1. **Bring a bucket of water** to the garden.  
2. **Use a sharp, clean pair of snips**.  
3. **Cut stems at a 45° angle** to increase water uptake.  
4. **Choose the longest stems** you can find.  
5. **Remove any leaves or side branches** low on the stem—leaves underwater rot.  
6. **Plunge the stems into water immediately** after cutting.

## 5. Leave Flowers to Condition

Many gardeners skip this step.  
**Conditioning** lets flowers soak up water before arranging:

- Place the bucket in a **cool spot** (laundry room, bathroom, garage).  
- Keep the bucket **full of water**.  
- Let the flowers sit **for a few hours or overnight**.  
- The buds will become fully hydrated and plump.

## 6. Arrange the Blooms

1. **Clean the vase** with dish soap or a 10 % bleach solution.  
2. **Fill it with fresh water**.  
3. **Recut stems** to the desired length at a 45° angle.  
4. **Arrange** as you like—no leaves underwater!

## 7. Use a Preservative

Preservatives (or “flower food”) add acids and sugars to kill bacteria and help flowers absorb water.

### Simple Homemade Recipe

| Ingredient | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| Sugar | 1 tsp |
| Household bleach | 1 tsp |
| Lemon juice **or** vinegar | 2 tsp |
| Water | 1 L |

Mix well and add to the vase water.

## 8. Ongoing Care

- Keep vases **out of direct sunlight** and in a cool part of the house.  
- **Replace the water every couple of days**.  
- **Recut stems** if they become soggy or moldy.  

With a little extra care, your home‑grown blooms will stay fresh and beautiful longer.
