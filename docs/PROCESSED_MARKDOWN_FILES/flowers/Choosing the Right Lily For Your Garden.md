# Choosing the Right Lily For Your Garden

**30 August 2025**

---

Lilies are the **height‑setting, colour‑bursting, fragrant stars** of any summer border. In Australia they often bloom around Christmas, giving gardeners a perfect excuse to showcase their beds.  
With **over 90 species** and **hundreds of hybrids**—and new varieties released every year—finding the right lily can feel daunting. A quick look at the nine lily divisions will simplify your decision and let you know what to expect in terms of flower size, scent, and bloom period.

> **Tip:** The basic care routine is the same for all lilies—just plant at the right depth, keep the soil moist but not soggy, and give them a sunny spot. Hybrid lilies (especially Asiatics, Orientals, and Inter‑divisional hybrids) are the most beginner‑friendly.
