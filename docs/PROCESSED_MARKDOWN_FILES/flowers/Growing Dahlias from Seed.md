*Growing Dahlias from Seed*

While most gardeners start with tubers, growing dahlias from seed can be **affordable** and opens the door to exciting new varieties. Saving your own seed is simple, and you might discover a unique seedling with unusual colour, size, or other appealing traits—perhaps even the next must‑have dahlia cultivar!

## Why Grow Dahlias from Seed?

- **Cost‑effective** – Tubers can be pricey, especially if you’re building a diverse collection. Seeds let you experiment with colour, shape, and size without breaking the bank.  
- **Widely available** – In Australia, interstate biosecurity limits tuber movement, but dahlia seeds can be posted nationwide (just meet the paperwork and inspection requirements).  
- **Genetic diversity** – Seeds are not true‑to‑type. Each seedling may reveal a new bloom, adding a thrilling element of surprise to your garden. Think of it as a gardening lottery!

## Buy Seed or Save Your Own?

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Buy seed** | • Convenient and quick<br>• Commercial mixes often target a single flower type (e.g., cactus, single, decorative) or a specific colour (e.g., *Sunny Reggae* orange anemones, *Fireworks Mix* single sunset tones) | • Seeds don’t grow true to type; you’ll get a mix of variations |
| **Save your own** | • Free<br>• Adds a personal touch | • Requires a bit of end‑of‑season work<br>• Likely a random mix of types and colours unless you isolate and hand‑pollinate |

## How to Save Dahlia Seeds

1. **Let flowers set seed** – Keep a few blooms on the plant until the end of the season. Seeds form in the disc florets at the flower’s centre.  
2. **Dry the seed heads** – Leave them on the plant to dry, or cut and hang them in a sheltered spot for a few weeks.  
3. **Harvest the seeds** – Once dry, pull apart the seed heads over a plate or tray. Dahlia seeds are small, sturdy, black, and pellet‑shaped, wedged between the dried petals. Remove all petals and chaff so only the seeds remain.  
4. **Check dryness** – Press a seed between your finger and thumb; it should **snap** rather than bend.  
5. **Label and store** – Place the seeds in a paper envelope and keep them until planting time.

**Planting tip:** Sow seeds directly in the garden in spring, 10 mm deep and 30 cm apart. Germination usually takes **3–5 days**. For a full step‑by‑step guide, see our grow guide.

## Dahlia Seed FAQ

### Do dahlias grown from seed produce tubers?

Yes! Seed‑grown dahlias develop tubers just like tuber‑grown plants. If you love a particular seedling, the most reliable way to replicate it in future years is to **propagate the tuber**—label it and leave it in the ground, or lift, divide, and replant it.

### Why do my saved seeds produce single flowers?

Bees can more easily access pollen from single flowers than from double flowers with closed centres. If you’re hoping for doubles, **save seeds from a double cultivar** you like. At least one parent will carry the genetics for double flowers.

### Do I have a new cultivar?

Each seed‑grown dahlia has its own unique genetics. To claim a new cultivar:

1. Grow the plant for several seasons to confirm it’s **genetically stable** (consistent flower traits).  
2. **Bulk up** the tubers by growing and dividing them over multiple seasons.  
3. If you want the plant on the show bench, it must be **shown and assessed** at dahlia society shows before it can be officially named.

Embracing the natural genetic diversity of seed‑grown dahlias adds adventure to your gardening journey. Whether you buy or save your own seeds, this method opens doors to new possibilities and makes dahlia cultivation a truly rewarding experience.
