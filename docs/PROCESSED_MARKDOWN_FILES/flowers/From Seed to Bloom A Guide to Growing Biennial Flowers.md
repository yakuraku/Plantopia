# From Seed to Bloom: A Guide to Growing Biennial Flowers

## What Is a Biennial?  

Biennials are plants that complete a **two‑year life cycle**:  

- **Year 1:** Grow roots and leaves.  
- **Year 2:** Flower, set seed, and die.  

> *In practice, the “two‑year” rule can blur, especially outside the Northern Hemisphere.*  

- **Southern Hemisphere:** Many biennials finish their cycle in one calendar year.  
  - Plant in late summer or autumn → flower the following spring → die in summer.  
  - Life cycle is best described as **two growing seasons** rather than two calendar years.  
- **Variations:**  
  - Some survive the second summer, flowering again in autumn before setting seed.  
  - Others live longer if flowers are cut regularly, slipping into the “short‑lived perennials” category.  

**Bottom line:** Biennials need time to mature before they bloom and will not become permanent fixtures in your garden.

## When to Plant Biennial Flowers  

Successful biennials require a bit of planning.  

| Climate | Recommended Planting Time | Key Tips |
|---------|--------------------------|----------|
| **Australian (temperate)** | Late summer or early autumn | Give seedlings time to build a strong root system before winter. |
| **Cold climates** | Late summer or early autumn | Ensure plants survive winter cold; they’ll revive and flower the next spring. |
| **Subtropical/Tropical** | Autumn | Plants often reach maturity and flower before hot temperatures halt growth. |

**General care:**  
- **Soil:** Moist but not water‑logged.  
- **Fertiliser:** Add a top‑up in late winter.  
- **Dead‑heading:** Regularly remove spent blooms to extend flowering time and lifespan.
