# Bulb Lasagne: Layered Planting for Spectacular Bulbs  

30 August 2025  

*Bulb Lasagne* brings a burst of colour and cheer to gardens after a long winter. Planting bulbs in containers is a popular way to create a concentrated splash of colour, and the bonus is that pots can be moved to fill gaps or add interest to a drab space. Containers also provide excellent drainage, reducing the risk of bulb rot.

## What Is a Bulb Lasagne?  

A **bulb lasagne** is a layering technique that stacks different bulbs in a pot to produce a *succession of flowers* that lasts for several weeks.  
- Think of it as a botanical version of the Italian dish: **bulbs** are the pasta sheets, and **soil** is the sauce that keeps each layer separate.  
- By choosing bulbs with staggered flowering times, you create a *continuous display* from early spring to late bloom.  
- Add winter‑flowering annuals (pansies, violas) on top to keep the pot vibrant while the bulbs are still dormant.

## Selecting Bulbs  

To build a successful lasagne, pick **two or three** different bulb types per container.  
- **Rule of thumb:**  
  - **Bottom layer:** larger, later‑flowering bulbs  
  - **Middle layer:** mid‑season flowers  
  - **Top layer:** earliest‑flowering bulbs  
- Example recipe:  
  - Bottom: Tulips  
  - Middle: Hyacinths  
  - Top: Miniature daffodils  

**Colour choices** are yours to decide. You can create a *gradual colour transition* or stick to classic palettes (all white, black‑and‑white, fiery reds/oranges/yellows).

| **Bottom layer** | **Middle Layer** | **Top Layer** |
|------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Tulip | Daffodil | Jonquil |
| Tulip | Hyacinth | Muscari, spring star, or miniature daffodil |
| Late daffodil | Mid‑season daffodil | Early daffodil |
| Late tulip | Mid‑season tulip | Early tulip |

## How to Plant a Bulb Lasagne  

1. **Choose a pot** that’s at least **30 cm deep and wide**.  
2. **Add 10–15 cm** of high‑quality potting mix to the bottom.  
3. **Plant the first layer** of bulbs on the soil.  
   - In containers you can space bulbs *closer* than in the ground for a fuller look.  
   - Plant the bottom layer **20–25 cm deep**.  
4. **Cover** with more soil.  
5. **Repeat** with the remaining layers, ensuring the final soil layer sits a few centimeters below the pot’s rim.  
6. **Water** thoroughly. Keep the soil **slightly moist** until shoots emerge, then water as usual.  
7. **After the first flowers fade**, cut them to ground level. This encourages the next layer to push through and bloom.

## After the Bloom  

Bulbs grown in containers are usually treated as **annuals** and discarded after flowering.  
- If you want *repeat flowering*, remove the bulbs once the leaves die back, store them in a cool, dry place, and re‑plant them in the garden next autumn.
