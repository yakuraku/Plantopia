## 1. Blue Butterfly Pea (**_Clitoria ternatea_**)

- **What it is** – A tropical vine grown as an annual in cooler climates.  
- **Why you’ll love it** – Brilliant sapphire‑blue flowers that double as a natural food dye and a *health‑boosting* ingredient (research is still underway).

### How to Use It

| Step | Action | Tips |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | **Steep** 4 g of dried or fresh flowers in hot water for 10–15 min. | Use fresh flowers for a brighter hue. |
| 2 | **Strain** and add a splash of citrus juice or a drizzle of honey. | Citrus will shift the color from blue to a lovely pink. |
| 3 | **Serve** as a tea, cocktail, or base for a colorful drink. | Mix with lemon syrup or tonic water for a “chameleon” effect. |

- **Cocktail hack** – Distillers have created a blue gin that turns pink when mixed with acidic tonic.  
- **Non‑alcoholic version** – Add lemon juice or lemon syrup to water for a vibrant, color‑changing beverage.

- Prefer organically grown plants for the best flavor.

### Cooking Ideas

| Method | How to Prepare | Result |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Bake** | Toss with olive oil, salt, and herbs; bake at 200 °C for 30 min. | Crispy edges, soft center. |
| **Boil** | Simmer in salted water until tender; mash or serve whole. | Classic “sweet potato” texture. |
| **Roast** | Cut into cubes, roast at 220 °C with spices. | Caramelized, earthy flavor. |
| **Mash** | Boil, then mash with butter or yogurt. | Creamy, versatile side dish. |
