## **Why Crystallise Flowers?**  
Crystallised flowers are a stunning way to preserve delicate blooms and add a touch of old‑fashioned elegance to cakes, pastries, salads, and more. They’re perfect for impressing high‑tea guests or creating cheerful, sustainable garnishes.

> **Important safety note:**  
> Traditional recipes use raw egg whites, which can carry *Salmonella*. Avoid using raw eggs, especially if you’re preparing food for infants, children, the elderly, or anyone with a weakened immune system.  
> **Safe alternatives:** pasteurised egg‑white powder, sugar syrup, or a vegan egg replacer.

## **Method**

### 1. **Choose the Right Flowers**  
- Pick blooms that are both beautiful *and* safe to eat.  
- Opt for **simple, flat flowers** for the easiest crystallisation.  
- If you’re working with bulkier varieties (e.g., roses), separate them into individual petals.  
- Use **home‑grown** or **edible‑flower** varieties from a grocery store or farmer’s market—avoid florist‑grown flowers that may have been sprayed with chemicals.

### 2. **Prepare the Egg Substitute**  
1. **Mix** a small amount of egg‑white powder or vegan substitute according to the packet instructions.  
2. **Avoid bubbles**—foam can cause the sugar to clump.  
3. **If using sugar syrup:**  
   - Combine ¼ cup sugar + ¼ cup water in a saucepan.  
   - Heat until dissolved, then cool to room temperature (heat can wilt the flowers).  
4. **Test the consistency** with a paintbrush on a discarded petal.  
   - The liquid should coat easily and leave a thin, sticky film without pooling.  
   - Add water ¼ teaspoon at a time if the mixture is too thick.

### 3. **Coat the Flowers**  
- Gently brush the **entire surface** of each flower (front and back) with the prepared mixture.  
- Hold the petals with tweezers or lay them on baking paper—whichever feels most comfortable.

### 4. **Add Sugar**  
- Hold the coated flowers over a bowl of caster sugar and **sprinkle** gently, shaking off excess.  
- *Alternative:* Drop the flowers into the sugar; this works for some but may cause clumping—experiment to find what gives you the finest, even coating.

### 5. **Dry the Flowers**  
- Place the sugar‑coated petals on a tray lined with baking paper.  
- Let them dry for **about 24 hours**.  
- Inspect to ensure they’re completely dry—this sugar seal preserves colour and texture.

### 6. **Store the Flowers**  
- Transfer the dried petals to an airtight container.  
- Separate layers with baking paper and add a food‑safe silicone pouch or folded paper towel to absorb moisture.  
- Proper storage keeps them fresh for **several months**.

## **Tips for Success**

- **Harvest in the morning** when flowers are fully open but still dry.  
- Use the petals **within an hour** of harvesting for maximum vibrancy.  
- For bulky flowers, use individual petals; for delicate ones, whole blooms can create a dainty look—experiment to find your preferred style.  
- Apply the egg white or substitute **thoroughly**: a thin, even coat protects the flower and prevents sugar clumping.
