# How to Grow Flower Bulbs

---

## When to Plant

- **General rule:**  
  - *March–May* in cold‑temperate regions  
  - *April–May* in warmer areas  
- **Cool‑soil preference:** If the soil is still warm from summer, wait until it cools down before planting.  
- **Cold requirement:** Daffodils, hyacinths, and tulips need a period of chill to mimic frosty European winters (e.g., the Netherlands).

## Position

- **Sunlight:** Most bulbs thrive with **at least 6 h of sun** per day.  
  - In hot climates, a bit of afternoon shade protects flowers from wilting.  
- **Tree shade:** Plant under deciduous trees—sun in winter/early spring, shade later.  
- **Bulb choices for low light (<3 h sun):**  
  - Snowdrops, crocuses, grape hyacinths, snowflakes.  
- **Flowering favorites:** Daffodils, jonquils, tulips, alliums, ixia, freesias, lilies.

## Soil Preparation

1. **Turn the soil** a month before planting; remove perennial weeds.  
2. **Add organic matter**: homemade compost, aged manure, or a slow‑release fertilizer.  
3. **Drainage check:**  
   - Dig to a spade’s depth to ensure good drainage.  
   - Add sand or coarse organic material if soil is water‑retentive.  
   - Consider a raised bed if drainage is poor.

## How to Plant

| Bulb | Depth | Spacing |
|------|-------|---------|
| 4 cm tall daffodil | 8–12 cm | 8–12 cm |
| Anemones / ranunculi | 5 cm | – |

- **Rule of thumb:** Plant each bulb **2–3 × its height** deep.  
- **Orientation:** Pointed end up (except anemones/ranunculi, which go down).  
- **Pots:** Use fresh bulbs each time; after flowering, move them to garden soil.

### Practical Tips

- **Bulb planter:** Great for many individual bulbs—removes a core of soil automatically.  
- **Trench method (group planting):**  
  1. Dig a shallow trench **twice the depth** of your largest bulb.  
  2. Lay bulbs from the centre, pointed end up, spacing at least the bulb’s width.  
  3. Cover with soil, level the surface.  
  4. Water thoroughly.  
  5. Edge with stones and label for future reference.  
- **Mulch:** In warm climates, top with straw or lucerne to keep bulbs cooler.  
- **Pots vs. ground:** Fresh bulbs in pots; once they’ve flowered, transfer to garden soil.

## Cultivation

- **Watering:**  
  - *Immediately after planting* and during winter to keep soil moist.  
  - *Spring/Summer:* Deep watering once a week until leaves yellow after flowering.  
  - *After flowering:* Stop watering to avoid rot during dormancy.  
- **Fertilizer:**  
  - Usually unnecessary if soil was amended pre‑planting.  
  - Optional top‑dressing with compost in spring or all‑purpose fertilizer during flowering.  
- **Leave foliage:**  
  - Do **not** cut the long, droopy leaves after flowering.  
  - They feed the bulb for next year’s bloom.  
  - Hide browning foliage with annuals; prune only after leaves have fully dried.  
- **Bulb longevity:**  
  - Most bulbs stay in the ground for multiple seasons.  
  - In warm climates, tulips may need lifting and chilling for the next year.  
  - Heavy clay soils: lift bulbs to prevent rot.

## Bulb Care (Lifting & Storing)

1. **Loosen soil** around bulbs with a fork.  
2. **Gently remove** bulbs.  
3. **Dry** in a cool, shaded spot.  
4. **Trim** any remaining leaves.  
5. **Store** in a net bag in a cool, dry place until next planting season.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | What to Do |
|---------|------------|
| **Slugs & snails** | Collect at night, relocate to compost bin. |
| **Aphids / thrips** | Wipe foliage with damp cloth + soapy water or neem oil. |
| **No flowers** | Check for insufficient sun or poor drainage. Avoid early pruning of foliage. |
| **Overcrowding** | After a few years, lift the patch, divide, and replant the healthiest bulbs. |

## Final Notes

- **Patience pays off:** Bulbs are low‑maintenance once established.  
- **Enjoy the cycle:** From fresh shoots in spring to the next year’s blooms, your bulbs will keep bringing color with minimal effort.
