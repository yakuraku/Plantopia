# How to Grow Everlasting Daisies from Seed

**30 August 2025**

Everlasting daisies (*Xerochrysum bracteatum*), also called strawflowers, are hardy native perennials that burst into colour from spring to autumn. Their papery bracts come in a rainbow of hues, making them a favourite for fresh and dried arrangements. Though technically perennials, they’re prized for their long flowering season rather than longevity, so most gardeners replace them after a couple of years.

## Why Choose Everlasting Daisies?

- **Low‑maintenance**: Tolerant of poor soil, drought, and heat once established.  
- **Pollinator‑friendly**: Attract butterflies, bees, and other beneficial insects.  
- **Versatile**: Great for beds, borders, or informal wild‑flower patches.  
- **Floral appeal**: Golden centres surrounded by dense petals in colours from gold to deep burgundy.

*Paper daisies* (*Rhodanthe* spp.) and *showy everlastings* (*Schoenia filifolia*) share similar growing habits and uses, but the classic everlasting is the most common choice.

## Plant Size & Colour

| Height | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **80 cm – 1 m** | Standard compact, rounded shrubs. |
| **≈ 40 cm** | Dwarf varieties for tighter spaces. |

Flowers appear from **spring through autumn** in warmer climates, offering a continuous splash of colour.

## Growing Everlasting Daisies from Seed

### 1. Germination Basics

- **Seeds**: Usually germinate without pre‑treatment, but a brief cold stratification can boost rates.  
- **Ideal soil temperature**: **18–21 °C**.  
- **Light**: Seeds need light; sow on the surface, not buried.  
- **Sowing window**: Spring to autumn; autumn sowings give seedlings a slow start over winter, leading to early spring blooms.

### 2. Soil & Site Preparation

- **Full sun** is essential.  
- **Best soil**: Fertile, well‑drained, fine‑sanded texture.  
- **Bed prep**: Dig over beds, rake to a fine, even tilth, and remove weeds to reduce competition.

### 3. Sowing Techniques

#### a. Tray Sowing (for transplanting)

1. **Moisten** potting mix.  
2. **Sow** seeds on the surface, gently press down.  
3. **Cover** with a very fine layer (~1 mm) of mix.  
4. **Mist**—avoid washing seeds away.  
5. **Germination**: 7–14 days; failures usually due to lack of light or drying out.

#### b. Direct Broadcast (mimicking natural spread)

- Use **½ bucket of potting compost per m²**.  
- Mix in **3 g of seed per m²**.  
- **Water** the bed, then scatter the seed‑mix lightly over the surface.  
- The compost keeps seeds moist and prevents wind dispersal.

### 4. Transplanting & Spacing

- When seedlings reach **≈ 7 cm**, transplant to their final sunny spot.  
- **Spacing**: **50 cm** apart in each direction to allow room for growth.

## Ongoing Care

- **Watering**: Keep soil evenly moist during dry spells; avoid irregular soaking.  
- **Fertilizing**: A general‑purpose liquid fertilizer every **3 weeks** (starting when plants are 15–20 cm tall) can boost flower production.  
- **Pruning**: Lightly trim growing tips to maintain a compact shape, especially before the second flowering season.

## Harvesting & Using the Flowers

### Fresh Arrangements

1. **Timing**: Cut on a dry, sunny day right after the flowers open or in the late afternoon before dusk.  
2. **Post‑cut care**: Place stems in water immediately.  
3. **Support**: Wire the stem just below the flower and coil the wire downward to keep the stem upright.

### Drying for Long‑Term Use

1. **Remove lower leaves** from stems.  
2. **Tie** small bunches and hang upside down in a cool, dry, airy spot.  
3. **Result**: Dried flowers retain their shape and colour for **2 years or more**.

## Common Cultivation Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | Likely Cause | Quick Remedy |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **Slugs & Snails** | Young seedlings | Beer traps, organic pellets, or nematodes |
| **Aphids** | Younger plants | Horticultural soap or eco‑neem spray at first sign |
| **Powdery Mildew** | Humid conditions, mature plants | Organic fungicide |

These minor issues are usually manageable, and once established, everlasting daisies largely look after themselves.
