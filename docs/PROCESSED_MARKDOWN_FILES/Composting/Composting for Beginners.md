# Composting for Beginners

**4 March 2016**

Composting turns kitchen scraps and garden waste into **humus**—the dark, nutrient‑rich organic matter that revitalises soil.  
*Humus* is the product of microorganisms breaking down plant material, and it improves soil structure, fertility, and plant health—all while saving money and reducing landfill waste.

## Why Compost?

- **Boosts soil quality** – releases rich nutrients and builds structure.  
- **Cuts greenhouse gases** – encourages aerobic (oxygen‑rich) decomposition.  
- **Reduces waste** – keeps kitchen and garden refuse out of landfills.  
- **Recycles nutrients** – no need for artificial fertilizers.  
- **Supports soil life** – microbes help ward off disease and aerate the soil.  
- **Saves money** – eliminates the cost of commercial fertilizers.

## How Does It Work?

In a composting system, organic material is **confined** so decomposition speeds up, releasing nutrients quickly.  
You can start with a simple garbage can, a wooden box, or a purpose‑made bin—just keep adding kitchen and garden waste regularly.

## The Five Pillars of Effective Compost

| Pillar | What It Is | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Nitrogen (green ingredients)** | Kitchen scraps, fresh lawn clippings, garden weeds | Stimulates microbes that break down carbon. |
| **Carbon (brown ingredients)** | Leaves, branches, straw, pine needles | Provides heat and structure for the pile. |
| **Water** | Moisture level | Keeps microbes active; too much → anaerobic conditions. |
| **Oxygen** | Air in the pile | Enables aerobic decomposition; turn the pile to add it. |
| **Microorganisms** | Existing soil life or mature compost | Jump‑starts the process. |

*Tip:* A balanced mix is key—too much green makes the pile sloppy; too much brown slows it down.

## What to Add (and What to Avoid)

### Brown Ingredients  
- Leaves, dead plants, prunings  
- Straw, hay, pine needles  
- Wood ash, shredded newspaper, cardboard  
- Corn cobs, dryer lint, sawdust  

### Green Ingredients  
- Fruit and vegetable scraps  
- Fresh lawn clippings  
- Garden weeds (remove seeds first)

**Do’s**  
- Cut all materials into small, even pieces.  
- Remove weed seeds before adding.  

**Don’ts**  
- Add aggressive plants (e.g., couch grass, blackberries).  
- Use large chunks that take ages to break down.  
- Include glossy or coated paper.  
- Add diseased plants.  
- Throw in dairy, meats, bones, fish, or bread—pests will love it.  
- Throw in plastic, glass, or metal.

## Composting in Four Simple Steps

### 1. Choose Your Site  
- **Well‑drained** area with **daily shade** (sun dries it out).  
- If using a bin, drill drainage holes.  
- Starting on bare earth lets worms and microbes infiltrate the pile.

### 2. Pick Your Components  
- Mix green, brown, and moisture.  
- Add a handful of mature compost or garden soil to seed the pile.

### 3. Build Layers  
1. **Bottom layer** – 10–15 cm of coarse twigs/branches (good drainage).  
2. **Green layer** – clippings, kitchen scraps.  
3. **Brown layer** – dry leaves, straw.  
4. Repeat until the bin is full.  
5. **Top layer** – a sprinkle of garden soil or mature compost.

*Keep each layer moist but never soggy.*

### 4. Maintain the Pile  
- **Turn** with a garden fork every 1–2 weeks to aerate.  
- **Water** as needed—aim for damp, not wet.  
- Check for odors or pests during turns.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Smelly pile** | Too wet, lack of oxygen, too many greens | Add dry leaves, ash, or lime; turn more often; improve drainage |
| **Pests** | Unsealed food, lack of turns | Turn frequently; add a wire mesh under the bin; cover new food with soil or clippings |
| **Slow‑maturing** | Missing oxygen or water, low temperature | Add nitrogen‑rich material; turn more; add water |
| **Matted materials** | Wet chunks clump together | Break up with a pitchfork; let dry before adding |
| **Fly buzz** | Attracting bugs | Cover with clippings or lime; keep the pile tidy |
| **Steaming pile** | **Good!** | Indicates active decomposition |

## When Is Your Compost Ready?

- **Time frame:** 3 weeks to 6 months, depending on weather, ingredients, and method.  
- **Seasonal tip:** Spring and summer speed things up; autumn and winter slow them down.

**Signs of readiness:**  
- Dark, crumbly texture.  
- Earthy, not rotting smell.  
- Mostly broken‑down material; a few sticks or shells may remain.

If you find too many un‑decomposed pieces, hand‑pick them out or screen the mix with a garden sieve. Re‑add them to your next pile.
