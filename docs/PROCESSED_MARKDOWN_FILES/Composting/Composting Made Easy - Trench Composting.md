# Composting Made Easy – Trench Composting  
**26 May 2022**

Compost is the *magic ingredient* that turns kitchen scraps into a nutrient‑rich, water‑retentive soil amendment. It feeds the friendly microbes that keep your garden healthy, reduces landfill waste, and closes the loop on your garden’s own food chain.  
If you’re not keen on above‑ground bins or bays, **trench composting** offers a tidy, underground alternative that saves space and keeps odors at bay.

## What Is Trench Composting?

Trench composting means building a compost pile *inside* a dug‑out trench in your garden soil.  
- **Fill** the trench with kitchen scraps and garden waste.  
- **Cover** it with soil and let it break down.  
- After **6 months to a year**, the enriched soil is ready for planting.

It’s perfect for long‑term soil improvement and for feeding hungry crops like beans, squashes, melons, and pumpkins. The classic “bean trench” used by English allotment gardeners is a great example of this technique.

## How to Trench Compost – Step‑by‑Step

You can start any time, but many gardeners begin in **autumn** so the trench is ready for summer crops.

| Step | Action | Tips |
|------|--------|------|
| **1** | **Dig** a trench 30–60 cm deep, 60 cm wide, and as long as you need. | Use a shovel or post hole digger. |
| **2** | **Fill** with a 50:50 mix of green and brown waste. Leave 15 cm at the top for backfilling. | You can fill all at once or add gradually over weeks. |
| **3** | **Water** the trench thoroughly. | Moisture speeds decomposition. |
| **4** | **Backfill** with the soil you removed. Add an extra 5–10 cm on top to account for compaction. | If adding in layers, cover each layer with a thin soil coat. |
| **5** | **Wait** ~6 months before planting. | Sow a green‑manure crop on top while it breaks down for extra benefit. |

**Alternative layout**:  
- Divide a bed into thirds: two thirds for crops, one third trench‑composted.  
- Rotate the thirds each year so every third gets enriched every three years.  
- Or trench between rows of crops for continuous improvement.

**Mini‑version**:  
- *Dig‑and‑drop compost holes*—small holes instead of a full trench—great for composting around mature plants or when space is tight.

## What to Compost

Aim for a **50:50 green‑to‑brown ratio**. While the exact mix isn’t critical, it helps the process along.

| Green Waste | Brown Waste |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fruit & veg scraps | Dead leaves |
| Grass clippings | Small prunings |
| Annual weeds (no seed) | Shredded non‑shiny paper |
| Flowers | Ripped non‑shiny cardboard |
| Plastic‑free teabags | Straw |
| Coffee grounds |  |

**Avoid**:  
- Meat & fish (unless buried ≥70 cm deep and left long enough)  
- Diseased plants  
- Perennial weeds (e.g., dandelions)  
- Weed seeds

## Advantages of Trench Composting

| Benefit | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **No unsightly bins** | Keeps your garden looking tidy. |
| **Space‑saving** | Compost is underground, freeing surface area for growing. |
| **Low maintenance** | No turning or ratio‑watching required. |
| **Built‑in mulch** | Soil stays richer and retains moisture, great for dry areas. |
| **Soil structure** | Digging breaks up compaction, improving root growth. |
| **Labor‑efficient** | Finished compost is already in the soil—no spreading needed. |

## Disadvantages to Keep in Mind

| Drawback | What to Watch For |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Initial digging** | Labor‑intensive setup, though you can spread it out over time. |
| **Space usage** | Trench occupies garden area; don’t plant food crops immediately—wait 6 months–1 year. |
| **Anaerobic nature** | Less air means slower decomposition and a bit more methane release than aerobic composting. |  
  *But* a small trench emits negligible methane and is still far better than landfill. |

Trench composting is a practical, low‑profile way to enrich your soil and recycle garden waste. If bins and bays aren’t your style, give this underground method a try and watch your plants thrive.
