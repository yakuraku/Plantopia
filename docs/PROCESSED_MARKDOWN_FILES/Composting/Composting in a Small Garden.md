# Composting in a Small Garden

**Composting in a Small Garden**  
*9 May 2016*  

The quality of your garden’s produce hinges on the soil it feeds. Even in a tiny unit, you can turn a patch of grass into a thriving, worm‑laden ecosystem that supplies fresh fruit and veggies all year round. Below is a practical guide to building a compact, efficient compost system that works with limited space.

## 1. Start with a Simple Standing Bin

- **Design**: A *bottomless* bin placed in the back corner of the yard.  
- **Preparation**: Chop all additions into small pieces and *turn* the contents regularly.  
- **Heat Build‑Up**: Regular turning generates heat, speeding decomposition.  
- **Access**: The bottom is hard to reach, so material there matures quietly.  
- **Harvesting**: Open the small doors, pull out compost, and let fresh material fall in from the soil below—this can increase the compost volume by at least a third.  
- **Location**: Place it under a coffee tree for shade and extra organic matter.

## 2. Upgrade to a Compost Tumbler

- **Why a Tumbler?**  
  - Faster turnover thanks to continuous mixing.  
  - Keeps the pile aerated and moist.  
- **Materials**:  
  - Dry leaves from your lychee tree.  
  - Kitchen scraps (fruit peels, vegetable trimmings).  
- **Challenge**: Daily kitchen scraps keep the tumbler from ever “finishing.”  
- **Solution**: Pair the tumbler with a worm bin to handle the excess kitchen waste.

## 3. Add a Worm Bin (Tiger Worms)

- **Why Tiger Worms?**  
  - They thrive in constant temperatures and break down kitchen scraps quickly.  
- **Construction**:  
  - Use a sturdy bucket with a lid to keep worms dark and critter‑proof.  
  - Drill a few small holes for *aeration* and moisture drainage into surrounding soil.  
  - Submerge the bucket enough to maintain a stable temperature (works in both cold and hot climates).  
- **Operation**:  
  - Place an empty bucket on top of the full one.  
  - Add fresh scraps, cover with shredded newspaper (or hessian/old cotton shirt).  
  - Worms climb into the upper bucket, leaving castings behind.  
  - Harvest castings from the lower bucket after ~1 week.  
  - Rotate the buckets: the upper becomes the new lower, and vice versa.

## 4. Two‑Bucket System in Action

- **Setup**:  
  - Keep two worm buckets in your garden.  
  - Use the top bucket for fresh kitchen scraps; the bottom bucket collects castings.  
- **Attracting Worms**:  
  - Potato peels or soft fruit are worm favorites—place them in the top bucket.  
  - A thin layer of shredded paper keeps moisture in.  
- **Harvesting**:  
  - After a week, the worms have moved up; remove the castings from the bottom bucket.  
  - Add a few shovelfuls of castings to mulch beds, pots, or any plant needing a nutrient boost.  
- **Worm Casting Tea**:  
  - Brew a tea from the castings to spread the benefits throughout the garden.

## 5. Managing Leachate & Critters

- **Leachate**:  
  - No need to collect it; it naturally seeps into the ground around the buckets.  
- **Critter Prevention**:  
  - Always cover buckets with a lid.  
  - Place the bin in dappled shade (e.g., inside an herb spiral) to deter birds and other pests.

## 6. The Circular System Diagram

> *Imagine a loop*:  
> 1. Kitchen scraps → **Worm Bin** → **Castings** → Mulch/Plants  
> 2. Compost Tumbler → **Finished Compost** → **Standing Bin** → Further Maturation  
> 3. Excess from Tumbler → Worm Bin (via the two‑bucket rotation)  

This synergy ensures *all* waste is recycled back into the garden, creating a self‑sustaining, three‑bay compost system—just like the big gardens, but scaled to your small space.
