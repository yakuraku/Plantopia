*How to Keep Millipede Numbers Under Control*

## Why Millipedes Aren’t the Worst Pest

- **Natural recyclers**: Most species munch on dead plant matter, turning it into rich, fertile soil.  
- **Soil aerators**: Their burrowing loosens compacted earth, boosting root growth.  
- **Occasional troublemakers**: When food runs low—especially in tidy gardens that clear out debris—millipedes may turn to fresh leaves, stems, or fruit.

If you notice nighttime damage and can’t spot the culprit, the many‑legged millipede is a likely suspect.

## Recognising Millipedes

| Feature | Millipede | Centipede |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Legs per segment** | **Two pairs** | One pair |
| **Antennae** | Short, paired | Long, paired |
| **Speed** | Slow, deliberate | Fast, scurrying |
| **Size** | 20–45 mm (most); up to 20 cm in rare species | Variable |
| **Leg count** | Up to 750 (not 1,000) | Varies |

- **Total native species**: ~2,000 in North America, plus many introduced.  
- **Common length**: 20–45 mm; the largest can reach 20 cm.  
- **Defensive behavior**: Curl into a tight coil and may release a foul‑smelling chemical that deters ants and other insects (harmless to humans but can irritate eyes).

## Millipede Habits & Life Cycle

- **Nocturnal**: Prefer damp, cool, dark spots with plenty of decaying organic matter.  
- **Mostly solitary** but can swarm when conditions are right—especially the **Portuguese millipede** (black, energetic, swarms in thousands after autumn rains).  
- **Reproduction**:  
  - Mating in spring.  
  - Eggs laid in moist soil.  
  - Hatching in autumn/early winter.  
  - Juveniles grow into fully formed, smaller adults.  
- **Longevity**: Several years; populations can build up under ideal conditions.

## Signs of a Millipede Problem

Look for these nighttime clues:

- **Irregular holes** on young leaves.  
- **Similar damage** on soft fruits.  
- **Sudden death** of seedlings (chewed roots or stems).  
- **Widespread damage** to potatoes and other root crops.

Millipedes will target any tender seedlings, mature plants, and fruits—especially those touching the soil (trailing leaves, young roots, stems). Common victims: strawberries, melons, tomatoes, potatoes, onions.

## Prevention & Control Strategies

Balancing the ecosystem is key. Here are practical, low‑impact tactics:

| Strategy | How It Helps | Tips |
|----------|--------------|------|
| **Use non‑organic slug/snail controls** | Effective against millipedes too | Choose methods that won’t harm beneficial insects. |
| **Avoid broad‑spectrum pesticides** | Chemicals kill predators (beetles, scorpions, ants, spiders) that keep millipedes in check | Reserve pesticides for severe swarms only. |
| **Manage mulch** | Well‑watered, organic mulch attracts millipedes; dry mulch deters them | Use gravel or dry mulch around at‑risk plants (e.g., strawberries). |
| **Rake bare beds** | Disturbs eggs/juveniles, exposing them to birds, predators, and sun | Do this at the start and end of the growing season. |
| **Control light** | Portuguese millipedes are attracted to light | Keep artificial lights away from vulnerable plants; use a sacrificial plant near light to trap them. |
| **Barrier for container plants** | Millipedes are poor climbers and dislike smooth surfaces | Raise pots, wrap bases in smooth plastic, keep soil away from plant parts. |

### Bottom Line

Millipedes are generally beneficial garden residents. By **minimizing their access to tender crops** and **supporting natural predators**, you can keep their numbers in check without drastic measures.
