## Why Slugs & Snails Are a Garden Menace  
Slugs and snails may look harmless, but they can *devastate* a row of seedlings in just a few hours. Traditional toxic pellets not only kill these pests but also endanger birds and small mammals that feed on the poisoned remains.  

**Enter the eco‑friendly, budget‑friendly beer trap** – a simple, effective way to keep your garden safe without harming wildlife.

## The Beer Trap Principle  
- **Attraction**: The yeasty aroma of beer lures slugs and snails.  
- **Capture**: They slip into a shallow pool and either drown or succumb to alcohol poisoning.  
- **Repetition**: Reset the trap each morning to keep the numbers down.

## Building Your Own Beer Trap  
You can craft a trap from a **standard 2‑liter plastic bottle** (or any similar container). Follow these steps for a reliable, rain‑proof design:

1. **Create the entrances**  
   - Cut two 4–6 cm square holes, facing each other, about 4 cm above the base.  
   - Leave the bottom edges uncut.

2. **Form the ramps**  
   - Fold the flaps downward and outward to give slugs a gentle path into the trap.

3. **Position the bottle**  
   - Bury it upright in your vegetable patch.  
   - Keep the soil level ~1 cm below the flaps—this prevents trapping beneficial beetles and other non‑target organisms.

4. **Secure the entrances**  
   - Add a little earth around the flaps to keep them open and accessible.

5. **Fill the trap**  
   - Pour beer into the base, stopping just below the entrance level.  
   - Avoid overfilling; you don’t want the pests to swim away.

6. **Enjoy a beer (optional)**  
   - Sit back, relax, and let the trap do its work.

7. **Maintenance**  
   - Check daily for captured slugs and snails.  
   - Remove them and refill with fresh beer as needed.

*Tip*: The built‑in cover keeps rain out, but if you’re in a heavy‑rain area, consider adding a simple lid or a piece of plastic sheeting.

## Placement Matters  
- **Don’t put it where the damage is worst**.  
- Place the trap a short distance from your prized plants and closer to hardy ones that can tolerate a little damage.  
- This strategy reduces the overall slug/snail population over time rather than concentrating them where they can do the most harm.

## Choosing the Right Liquid  
- **Beer**: Any inexpensive beer works—snails aren’t picky.  
- **Alternative**: If you’re reluctant to waste beer, mix a cup of water with 1 tsp each of sugar and flour, then stir in ½ tsp of ordinary baker’s yeast.  
  - *Note*: The lack of alcohol may slightly reduce effectiveness, but it still lures snails effectively.

## Ethical Gardening: Drawing the Line  
- **Live and let live** is a good philosophy, but an unchecked slug/snail army can ruin your crops overnight.  
- A homemade beer trap offers a *non‑chemical* solution that protects both your garden and the surrounding wildlife.
