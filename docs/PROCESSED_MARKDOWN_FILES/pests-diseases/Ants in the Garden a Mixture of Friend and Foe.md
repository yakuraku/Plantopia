# Ants in the Garden: A Mixture of Friend and Foe  

*30 August 2025*

## Why Ants Matter

Ants are astonishingly prolific: **over 10,000 species worldwide** and **more than 1,200 in Australia alone**. A single colony can house **tens of thousands of individuals**. While an infestation can bother gardeners, the reality is more nuanced.

## Australian Ants and Their Benefits

Most Australian garden ants fall into two groups:

| Size | Colour | Common Name | Typical Length |
|------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Small | Black | Garden / Common Ant | 1–3 mm |
| Large | Reddish‑brown | Brown Ant | 3–7 mm |

### What They Do for You

- **Pollinate** while foraging for nectar.  
- **Prey on pests** such as certain caterpillars.  
- Act as nature’s **garbage collectors**, clearing dead animals and fallen leaves.  
- Serve as a **food source** for birds, reptiles, and other wildlife, boosting local biodiversity.

## The Downsides

Not all ants are harmless. Invasive species can damage your garden and home.

| Ant | Problem |
|-----|---------|
| **Carpenter Ants** (imported from the US) | Attack wooden structures—fences, garden sheds, even houses. |
| **Fire Ants / Electric Ants** | Bite or sting, ranging from uncomfortable to painful. |
| **Other aggressive species** | Create an unpleasant environment. |

Even non‑aggressive ants can cause trouble when they arrive in numbers:

- **Scavengers** that nibble tender shoots, seedlings, and vulnerable plants.  
- **Sweet‑tasting** seed shells attract ants, leading to seed theft and weed proliferation.  
- **Pollen theft** can reduce pollination success, especially in plants with separate male and female flowers (e.g., pumpkins).  
- **Aphid farming**: ants protect and spread aphids, which then feast on your plants.  
- **Root disturbance**: nests dug near roots deprive plants of water and nutrients, stunting growth.  
- **Unsightly mounds** in lawns, play areas, and beds.  
- **Excessive aeration** can increase drainage, drying soil and making it water‑repellent.

A large ant population is simply a nuisance, invading homes and disrupting outdoor life.

## Do Ants Really Damage Plants?

Ants rarely cause direct damage by feeding. They won’t strip plants bare like caterpillars or snails. However, their **management of aphids** can lead to significant problems. If your tomatoes, lettuce, or soft fruits suffer repeated aphid attacks, check for ant activity.

## Keeping Ant Numbers in Check

While chemical baits can eliminate colonies, a more balanced approach preserves the benefits of smaller ant populations.

### Organic Control Tips

- **Invite predators**: Plant a diverse range of native flowers and shrubs to attract wasps, birds, and other ant‑eating insects.  
- **Diatomaceous Earth (DE)**: A fine, fossil‑plankton powder that kills hard‑shelled insects but is harmless to mammals, birds, and plants. Use a food‑grade product and sprinkle around vegetables, flowers, or outdoor dining areas.  
- **Odorous plant borders**: Lavender, fennel, chamomile, and peppermint deter ants from crossing boundaries.

## Stronger Eradication Methods

If an infestation is serious, more decisive action may be needed. Locate the nest—ant trails often lead straight to it—and try one of these treatments:

- **Boiling water**: Pour directly over the nest; repeat until cleared.  
- **White vinegar**: Drives ants away; slower but still effective.  
- **Sticky soap‑oil mixture**: Mix 1 part liquid soap, 3 parts cooking oil, and enough water to combine. This suffocates the nest.  
- **Borax powder**: Sprinkle on the nest or use in a sugary bait that ants carry back to the colony.  
- **Pesticide sprays**: Use only as a last resort due to risks to beneficial wildlife and the environment.

## Ant Infestations in Pots

Ants over‑aerate pot soil, causing rapid drying and water repellency.

**Rescue method**:

1. Soak the pot in a bucket of water, leaving the soil surface just below the water line.  
2. Wait until bubbles stop appearing.  
3. Remove the pot and place it in a sunny spot to dry slightly.  
This drowns the ants while rehydrating the compost, allowing normal watering to resume.

## Keeping Ants Clear of Living Areas

Even if you appreciate garden ants, you’ll likely want them out of outdoor living spaces and inside your home. Here are chemical‑free ways to keep them at bay:

- **Eliminate food scraps**: Clear debris after every meal, including spilled drinks.  
- **Break pheromone trails**: Scrub with soapy water or spread Vaseline to create a sticky barrier.  
- **Sugar bait traps**: Place small bowls of sugar paste around living areas; ants are attracted but get stuck.  
- **Irritating sprays**: Make a mixture of garlic, chili, and black pepper and spray along common paths.

**Remember**: Ants are a vital part of the ecosystem. By using organic methods to keep their numbers in check, you protect their ecological benefits while preventing them from taking over your garden.
