# Cutworm: How to Protect Your Vulnerable Seedlings

## Why Cutworms Are a Big Deal for Seedlings

Most adult moths are garden allies—food for birds, small mammals, and even a touch of pollination.  
But their caterpillars? Not so friendly. When your beds are full of tender seedlings, cutworms are among the most dreaded visitors.

In Australia, the **Bogong moth** (*Agrotis infusa*) is a protected cutworm species, so using broad‑spectrum pesticides isn’t always the best move. Let’s explore eco‑friendly ways to keep your seedlings safe.

## Are Cutworms the Root of Your Problem?

Cutworms are the larval stage of several *Agrotis* moths. Their feeding habits can wreck seedlings in a flash:

- **Target:** Base of the stem at soil level.  
- **Result:** Plants can collapse overnight; sometimes the stem is severed and foliage is shredded on the ground.

### Spotting the Culprit

| What to Look For | Why It Matters |
|------------------|----------------|
| **Timing** – Eggs laid in late autumn, larvae emerge in winter. Damage peaks in late winter/early spring when seedlings first appear. | Helps you anticipate attacks. |
| **Habitat** – Live in organic debris. Mulched or overgrown beds are prime cutworm zones. | Indicates where to focus control. |
| **Eggs** – Small, creamy, sometimes hidden in soft webbing on leaves, mulch, or grass blades. | Early removal stops the cycle. |
| **Larvae** – Brown, grey, or green; up to 4 cm long; smooth‑bodied with few hairs. | Confirms the pest. |
| **Nighttime Activity** – Most active at night. Use a torch to spot them. | Night inspections are key. |
| **Behavior** – Curl up when disturbed. A twig prod can reveal a cutworm. | Quick identification trick. |
| **Droppings** – Tiny, black, pellet‑shaped. Slug droppings are larger, softer, and S‑shaped. | Distinguish from other pests. |

## Management & Control Options

### 1. Think Before You Spray

- **Why?** Adult moths benefit the ecosystem, and the Bogong moth is endangered.  
- **Goal:** Keep cutworms in check *without* wiping out beneficial insects.

### 2. Cultural Practices First

| Action | How It Helps |
|--------|--------------|
| **Nightly inspections** | Catch larvae early. |
| **Hand removal** | Eliminates eggs/larvae, though not all will be found. |
| **Soil tilling** | Disturbs unhatched eggs and freshly emerged larvae before sowing or transplanting. |
| **Remove large organic matter** | Cuts off cover and breeding sites. |
| **Eliminate mulch near seedlings** | Removes a food source and shelter. |

### 3. Physical Barriers

- **Seedling collars** – Cut a plastic bottle, fold thick aluminium foil, or roll cardboard.  
  - Push 5 cm into the soil, extend 5 cm above the soil line.  
  - Creates a barrier that keeps cutworms from reaching the stem.

### 4. Timing Transplants

- **Start indoors or on a bench** – Grow seedlings larger before planting out.  
- **Delay transplanting** – Wait until late spring when larvae have matured into moths and are no longer a threat.

### 5. Encourage Natural Predators

- **Birds, ladybirds, damsel bugs, predatory wasps** feed on eggs and larvae.  
- **Avoid excessive chemicals** – They reduce the very insects that help control cutworms.

## Bottom Line

Cutworms can devastate seedlings in just a few hours, but you don’t have to reach for insecticides right away. By combining **early detection, cultural tweaks, physical barriers, smart transplant timing, and predator support**, you can keep cutworm damage at bay while fostering a healthy, diverse garden ecosystem.
