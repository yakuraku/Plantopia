# DIY White Oil

*DIY White Oil*  

White oil is a **pest spray** that controls sucking and chewing insects by acting as a *suffocant*—it smothers pests rather than poisons them. Unlike commercial horticultural oils, white oil’s main ingredient is vegetable‑based, making it cheaper to produce and more eco‑friendly.

## What Can It Be Used For?

White oil targets **soft‑bodied pests** such as:

- Aphids  
- Mealybugs  
- Scale insects  
- Spider mites  
- Whiteflies  
- Fruit moths  

It works best when pests are in their early stages and populations are small. Because it is a contact pesticide, a **thorough application** is essential; the spray clogs pest pores or disrupts cell function, suffocating them.  

**Benefits**

- Pests cannot develop resistance.  
- Short‑lived (≤ 1 day) → targeted use, but repeat sprays are often needed.  
- Minimal impact on beneficial insects (e.g., bees, ladybirds, beetles), though ladybird larvae may be affected.

**Alternatives**

- Let a few aphids or whiteflies stay if damage is minimal.  
- Gently wipe infestations with a damp cloth.  
- Remove soft growth that attracts pests (e.g., on fruit trees or broad beans).  
- Use a commercial vegetable‑oil spray like *Eco‑Oil* if you prefer not to DIY.

## How to Make White Oil

The process has two stages: **make a concentrate** and then **dilute it for spraying**.  

### 1. Make the Concentrate

| Ingredient | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| Detergent (bleach‑free, additive‑free) | ½ cup |
| Vegetable oil | 1 cup |

1. Combine the detergent and oil in a jar.  
2. Shake well until the mixture turns a *sudsy white*.  
3. Label the jar with the recipe and dilution instructions.  

**Storage:** Keep in a cool, dry place. The concentrate lasts ~3 months; give it a good shake before diluting.

### 2. Make the Spray

1. Shake the concentrate jar.  
2. Add **10–20 ml** of concentrate to **1 L of water**.  
3. Pour into a spray bottle—ready to use.  

*Tip:* Mix only what you’ll use in a single session; the diluted solution doesn’t store well and can clog nozzles. After spraying, clean equipment with warm water + a drop of detergent.

## How to Apply White Oil

1. **Test first**  
   - Spray a small area of the plant to ensure tolerance.  
   - Avoid hairy or very soft leaves—they may burn.  

2. **Timing & Conditions**  
   - Apply when the weather is **dry, cool, and calm**.  
   - Avoid windy or rainy days; rain washes the oil away.  
   - Temperatures above 30 °C can scorch leaves—don’t spray on hot days.  
   - Early morning is ideal to protect beneficial insects.  

3. **Coverage**  
   - Apply liberally to the topside *and* underside of leaves, plus stems/branches.  
   - For fruit trees, a preventative spray in spring (before blooming) is useful; otherwise, wait for visible infestation.  

4. **Frequency**  
   - Repeat every **2–3 weeks** to keep pest populations low.  
   - Apply as soon as you spot signs of an infestation.
