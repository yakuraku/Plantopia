## Why Cabbage Moth Decoys Matter

The adult cabbage moth is a *plain* creature—no flashy colors, no dramatic patterns. If your garden only hosts adults, you might not even notice them. But when a female lands on a cabbage, broccoli, or other brassica and lays eggs, the real trouble begins. The resulting caterpillars devour leaves at a rapid pace, often stripping plants down to their stems and causing irreversible damage.

Because it’s hard to control a sudden caterpillar outbreak in time, the best strategy is to **prevent eggs from being laid in the first place**. Netting can help, but it’s cumbersome and moths can squeeze through even tiny gaps. A smarter, 100 % organic solution is to *confuse* the moths with decoys that make them think your patch is already occupied.

## What Are Cabbage Moth Decoys?

- **Fake moths** that *mimic* the real ones.
- They trick females into believing there’s already a resident population.
- Cabbage moths are territorial; a female will avoid laying eggs where competition is high.
- Even a single decoy can redirect egg‑laying to less desirable spots, giving your brassicas a chance to thrive.

> *Effectiveness varies:* some gardeners see dramatic reductions in caterpillars, others notice little change. The upside—no harm and minimal effort—far outweighs the small time investment.

## Making Your Own Decoys

You can buy realistic decoys, but moths are simple creatures. A DIY version is cheaper, eco‑friendly, and just as effective when built correctly.

### Materials Needed

| Item | Suggested Source |
|------|------------------|
| **Permanent black marker** | Any weather‑proof marker |
| **White weather‑proof material** | Clean milk bottles, yogurt tubs, ice‑cream containers, sturdy plastic bags |
| **Garden string or thin wire** | For attaching or suspending |
| **Canes, twigs, or skewers** | To mount the decoys |

> **Tip:** Use household items that would otherwise be discarded—great for sustainability!

### Step‑by‑Step Guide

1. **Print the Template**  
   Download the printable outline [here](#) and trace it onto your white plastic. Cut along the lines.

2. **Add the Signature Black Dots**  
   Use the permanent marker to draw the black spots on the wings. These are the *most critical* feature for fooling the moth.

3. **Mount the Decoy**  
   - If the material is sturdy, a quick poke with a skewer may hold it.  
   - Otherwise, tie a short length of string or wire to the back and secure it to the skewer.  
   - *Optional:* Let the string hang loosely so the decoy flutters naturally in the breeze.

4. **Strategic Placement**  
   - Scatter decoys throughout your veggie patch, especially near brassicas.  
   - Vary heights and orientations to mimic a natural moth population.  
   - Keep them roughly at plant level for realism.

> **Result:** As wind lifts the wings, the decoys bob and flutter, convincing visiting females to lay eggs elsewhere.

## Quick Tips for Success

- **Use weather‑proof materials** to ensure durability.
- **Place decoys at different angles**—moths are less likely to notice a uniform pattern.
- **Refresh decoys** if they become damaged or lose their appearance.
- **Combine with other organic controls** (e.g., hand‑pick caterpillars) for best results.
