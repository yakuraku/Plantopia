## 🌱 What Is Blossom End Rot?

Blossom end rot is a common issue that shows up most often in **tomatoes**, but it can also affect **capsicum, chilli, squash, eggplant, cucumbers**, and other fruiting plants. It appears at the *watery end* of the fruit, giving it a sad, shriveled look.

### Diagnosing Blossom End Rot

- **Early signs**: A beige or yellow discoloration that feels *watery and tender* to the touch.  
- **Progression**: The area darkens, hardens, and the fruit looks shrunken and withered under the skin.  
- **Full‑blown rot**: The entire bottom half of the fruit can be affected.  
- **Leaf symptoms**: Occasionally, you’ll notice browned, curling leaf tips around the affected fruits.

## ❌ What Causes Blossom End Rot?

It’s **not** caused by a pathogen, fungus, or pest. The root problem is a **calcium deficiency** in the developing fruit. Calcium is essential, but most soils already contain enough; the issue is that the plant can’t use it effectively.

### Common culprits

| Cause | How it affects calcium uptake |
|-------|------------------------------|
| **Overwatering / heavy rain** | Dilutes calcium in the soil, slowing absorption. |
| **Underwatering / inconsistent watering** | Stresses the plant, disrupting overall nutrient uptake. |
| **Extreme soil pH (acidic or alkaline)** | Locks calcium (and other nutrients) in unavailable forms. |
| **Excess nitrogen** | 1️⃣ Promotes rapid leafy growth that diverts nutrients from fruit. 2️⃣ Converts calcium into a salt form that roots can’t absorb. |

## 💡 Prevention & Control

### 1. **Treat the problem early**  
- **Foliar feeding**: Dab or spray a diluted calcium solution on the leaves. It won’t rescue already‑rotted fruit, but it can reduce future occurrences.  
- **Prune affected fruit**: Remove rotting fruits promptly so the plant can focus energy on healthy ones. (They’re harmless, but composting or discarding is usually best.)

### 2. **Address the root causes**  
Focus on these four key areas to keep future fruit spotless.

#### • **Check and correct soil deficiencies**  
- **Soil test**: Identify calcium levels and pH.  
- **Calcium boost**: Add a calcium‑rich liquid feed before sowing.  
- **pH balance**:  
  - Slightly acidic soil → **lime** or **dolomite**.  
  - Balanced pH → **neutral gypsum**.

#### • **Use fertilizer wisely**  
- Keep nitrogen in check.  
- Opt for low‑nitrogen blends that include calcium.

#### • **Improve soil quality**  
- Add plenty of **organic matter** (compost, well‑rotted manure).  
- Enhance drainage and nutrient content.  
- Verify pH and adjust if needed.

#### • **Water consistently**  
- Water *regularly but sparingly* rather than sporadic drenchings.  
- Mulch to retain moisture, especially in hot or windy spots.

## 🌟 Bottom Line

Blossom end rot is common but manageable. By ensuring **balanced calcium availability**, **consistent watering**, and **proper fertilization**, you can keep your tomatoes, peppers, and other fruiting plants healthy and rot‑free—no chemicals or complicated treatments required.
