## Why You Should Watch Your Leaves

- **Yellowing or drooping leaves** can mean many things:  
  - *Natural aging* of lower leaves as the plant redirects energy to fruit.  
  - *Pest damage* (aphids, caterpillars, etc.).  
  - *Nutrient deficiencies*—a good dose of tomato feed often helps.  
  - **Diseases**—the culprit we’ll cover below.

If you can rule out pests and nutrition problems, it’s time to check for the 10 most common tomato diseases that show up in Australian gardens.

> **Tip:** Most of these infections spread quickly from plant to plant. Once you spot a wilting or diseased plant, remove it immediately to protect the rest of your crop.

## 1. Fusarium Wilt  

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Leaves start drooping and yellowing **from the base upward** once the plant flowers.  
  - Affected leaves turn brown, die, and the infection spreads to the vines.  
  - The plant eventually **fails completely**.  
- **Transmission:** Soil‑borne.  
- **Prevention:** Practice **crop rotation**—avoid planting tomatoes in the same spot year after year.

---

## 2. Verticillium Wilt  

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Similar to Fusarium, but the yellowing is **slower** and may not be obvious until the plant dies.  
  - Drooping begins in lower leaves and moves upward.  
- **Transmission:** Soil‑borne.  
- **Prevention:** **Crop rotation** is essential.

---

## 3. Bacterial Wilt  

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Leaves droop **starting at the upper, outer parts** of the plant, then move downward.  
  - The plant often dies **before** any spotting or browning appears.  
- **Prevention:** Keep plants healthy; avoid overwatering and maintain good airflow.

## 4. Mosaic Virus  

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Leaves develop **mottled yellow and dark green** patches.  
  - Stunted growth, rough texture, and twisting or curling tips.  
  - Fruits show **sunken brown patches** under the skin—still safe to eat but unappetizing.  
- **Transmission:** By aphids and other insects.

---

## 5. Leaf Curl Virus / Yellow Leaf Curl  

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Leaves turn **yellow** and roll inward.  
  - Foliage becomes thicker and wrinkled.  
  - Plants are weakened, stunted, and produce **small, inedible fruits**.  
- **Transmission:** Aphids.

---

## 6. Tomato Spotted Leaf Virus (TSLV)  

- **Symptoms:**  
  - **Bronzing** on the upper surface of young leaves.  
  - Followed by **black spots**, tip dieback, and downward cupping.  
  - Fruits may show blackened spots or uneven, blotchy coloring.  
- **Transmission:** Thrips.  
- **Impact:** Significant in Australian agriculture.

---

## 7. Powdery Mildew  

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Fine **white powder** on the upper leaf surface.  
  - Yellowing or brown spots beneath the mold.  
  - Eventually covers the entire leaf, killing it.  
- **Conditions:** Poor airflow in humid environments.  
- **Effect on fruit:** Usually unaffected.

---

## 8. Early Blight  

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Irregular patches on lower leaves with a **dark spot** in the center and yellow edges.  
  - Plants survive if the blight doesn’t reach more than halfway up the stem.  
- **Prevention:** Keep foliage dry, prune lower leaves, and use resistant varieties.

---

## 9. Target Spot  

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Small, slightly oval **dark brown or black spots** with concentric rings.  
  - Spots merge, killing most or all of the leaf.  
  - Fruits develop a dark spot near the stalk that can rot inward.  

---

## 10. Septoria Leaf Spot  

- **Symptoms:**  
  - Appears in **warm, wet weather**.  
  - Numerous small dark spots, especially near leaf tips.  
  - Spaces between spots turn yellow; the leaf may brown and wither.  
  - Fruits may be smaller but still edible.

## Quick Action Checklist

- **Inspect** lower leaves first; they’re the first to show trouble.  
- **Remove** any plant showing wilting, yellowing, or spotting—don’t let it linger.  
- **Rotate** crops yearly to break soil‑borne disease cycles.  
- **Improve airflow** and avoid overhead watering to reduce fungal risks.  
- **Use insect‑resistant varieties** and keep aphids/thrips in check.
