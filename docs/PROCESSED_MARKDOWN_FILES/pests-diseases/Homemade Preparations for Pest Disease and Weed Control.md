## 1. Vinegar Spray – A Simple, Natural Repellent  

- **What you’ll need**  
  - 1 Litre of household vinegar (5 % acetic acid)  
  - Spray bottle (preferably with a fine mist nozzle)  

- **How to use**  
  1. **Fill** the bottle with vinegar.  
  2. **Spray** a *fine mist* to coat the entire leaf surface, *including the undersides*.  
  3. **Apply** during **direct sunlight** for maximum efficacy.  
  4. **Repeat** 2–3 times for stubborn pests or diseases.  

- **Tip:** If you can find a stronger vinegar (10 % or higher), it works even better—just keep the same application method.

## 2. Salt‑Vinegar Mix – Targeted Weed Control  

- **Recipe**  
  - 1 cup of table salt  
  - 1 Litre of vinegar  

- **How to use**  
  1. **Mix** the salt into the vinegar until dissolved.  
  2. **Apply** directly to the weeds you want to eliminate.  

- **Caution**  
  - This solution is *non‑selective*; it will harm any plant it contacts.  
  - Use sparingly, as excess salt can *kill beneficial soil life*.

## 3. Boiling Water – Spot‑Treating Concrete Weeds  

- **Method**  
  1. **Boil** a kettle of water.  
  2. **Pour** the hot water directly onto weeds growing in cracks or concrete.  

- **Why it works**  
  - The heat damages the plant cells, effectively killing the weed without chemicals.

## 4. Practical Application Tips  

- **Coverage is Key**  
  - Ensure *complete coverage* of the target area, especially the leaf undersides.  

- **Use Only What You Need**  
  - Avoid over‑spraying; excess solution can waste resources and potentially harm nearby plants.  

- **Multiple Applications**  
  - Some pests or diseases may require more than one treatment.  
  - A *safer, more responsible* approach is to monitor and re‑apply as needed rather than a single heavy dose.  

- **Timing**  
  - Apply in the *morning* or *late afternoon* to reduce evaporation and allow the solution to work while the plant is active.

## 5. Environmental & Safety Considerations  

- **Selectivity**  
  - Vinegar and salt‑vinegar solutions are *non‑selective*; avoid spraying near desirable plants.  

- **Soil Health**  
  - Excess salt can *deplete soil microorganisms*. Use the salt‑vinegar mix only where necessary.  

- **Personal Protection**  
  - Wear gloves and eye protection when handling hot water or concentrated vinegar.
