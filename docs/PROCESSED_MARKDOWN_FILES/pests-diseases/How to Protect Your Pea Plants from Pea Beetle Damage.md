## Why Pea Beetles Are a Big Deal

Pea beetles (also called *pea weevils*, *Bruchus pisorum*) are specialists that love pea plants, but they’ll also target broad beans and soybeans.  
- **One generation per year** – a single, intense wave of damage.  
- They can *destroy an entire crop* by feeding on leaves, flowers, and the seeds inside pods.  
- In commercial settings they ruin seed stores; in the home garden they weaken plants and shrink harvests.

## What Damage Looks Like

| Plant Part | Typical Signs |
|------------|---------------|
| **Leaves** | Ragged, scalloped cuts along the edges. |
| **Flowers** | Damaged petals, reduced nectar. |
| **Pods** | Malformed or missing peas; tiny exit holes (~2.5 mm) left by emerging adults. |

If you plan to dry your peas, inspect each pod for malformed seeds or exit holes before storing.

## The Life Cycle in a Nutshell

1. **Eggs** – laid directly on growing pods.  
   - Small, white → darken to almost black before hatching.  
   - Visible with a careful scan.

2. **Larvae** – hatch in 2–4 weeks.  
   - Cream‑white, 6–7 mm long, legless, “C”‑shaped.  
   - Burrow into a single seed; tiny entry holes are hard to see.

3. **Pupation & Adult Emergence** – 40–50 days later.  
   - Exit hole ≈ 2.5 mm destroys seed viability.

4. **Overwintering** – adults retreat to the soil beneath the plant or remain dormant in stored seeds.

5. **Spring Resurgence** – adults emerge as peas flower, feed on nectar, and lay new eggs.

## Spotting the Adult Beetle

- **Size & Color** – ~6 mm, brown with speckles of white, black, or grey.  
- **Body Shape** – broad, rounded, short wide snout.  
- **Wing Cases** – incomplete, leaving a pointed abdomen visible.  
- **Where to Look** – underside of leaves in spring/early summer; soil beneath plants after harvest.

## Prevention & Control (Home Garden Edition)

> *Pesticides are rarely needed in a home garden. Simple, practical steps usually keep beetles at bay.*

### 1. Soil Management  
- **Till before sowing** – break up clods to create a fine, light texture.  
- **Add organic matter** – keeps soil light and discourages overwintering beetles.  
- **Prefer clay‑type soils** – beetles like moisture; loosening them reduces their habitat.

### 2. Timing Your Planting  
- **Plant early** – if flowers finish before beetles emerge, fewer eggs are laid.  
- **Harvest early** – before eggs hatch, you still get a usable crop.

### 3. Regular Inspection  
- **Check for eggs, larvae, or adults** every week.  
- **Remove** – pick off and drop into a bucket of soapy water.

### 4. Sanitation  
- **Dispose of heavily infested pods** – uproot and throw away; never compost.  
- **Clear volunteer plants** – remove any seedlings that sprout from fallen seeds.  
- **Remove plant debris** – at season’s end, take all remnants from the patch.

### 5. Last‑Resort Pesticide  
- If infestation is severe, use a food‑safe pesticide *specifically* targeting weevils.  
- **Beware** – it may affect beneficial insects.

## Bottom Line

Pea beetles can turn a promising pea crop into a disappointment. By understanding their life cycle, spotting early damage, and practicing good soil and plant hygiene, you can keep these pests under control and enjoy a bountiful harvest.
