*How to Keep Slater Numbers Under Control*

You might not recognise the name **_Porcellio scaber_**, but you’ll definitely know the bug it refers to. Introduced to Australia from Europe along with its close cousin **_Armadillidium vulgare_**, these common bugs have since taken on the more recognisable names of *slaters*, *butchy boys*, *pill bugs*, *wood lice*, and many more.

While they may provoke disgust or even fear when you unexpectedly uncover them, they play a vital role in your garden. **You definitely want them there – but you also don’t want their numbers to get out of hand.**

## How to Recognise Slaters

- **Size & look** – Segmented, grey‑brown bodies, 6 mm to 12 mm long.  
- **Legs** – Seven pairs that help them scurry for cover when disturbed.  
- **Defensive reflex** – If escape fails, they curl into a tight ball (hence the nickname *roley poley*).  
- **Biology** – One of the few land‑based crustaceans, sharing a family with prawns and crabs.  
- **Habitat** – Need damp conditions; they stay still during daylight, preferring dark, moist spots until night.  
  - Common hiding places: behind bark of rotting wood, under plant pots, inside organic mulches, under compost heaps.  
- **House visits** – Usually just exploring; most homes are too dry and bright, so they’re usually sent back outdoors.

## The Good and the Bad

| **Good** | **Bad** |
|----------|---------|
| **Nutrient recycler** – Feed on decaying organic material, returning nutrients to the soil and improving plant growth. | **Plant muncher** – Can nibble tender seedlings, soft fruits, and juicy stems of beans, melons, tomatoes, eggplants, and other nightshade‑family plants. |
| | If you see nibbling on nightshade plants, it’s almost certainly slaters. |

## Protecting Your Plants

Because slaters are essential to the nutrient cycle, **let them thrive in peace** unless they’re causing damage. Chemical control is effective but should be a *last resort*—it can harm beneficial garden residents.

### Practical, Non‑Chemical Tactics

- **Container gardening** – Grow at‑risk plants (e.g., strawberries) in raised beds or pots so no leaves or fruit touch the ground. Slaters can climb but usually avoid it; an extra obstacle often deters them.
- **Mulch wisely** – Mulch is a perfect slater habitat.  
  - *Avoid* mulch around tender plants until they’re mature.  
  - Keep seed beds neat to remove hiding spots.  
  - *Rake* mulch lightly once a week on a sunny day to disturb damp conditions and encourage slaters to move elsewhere.
- **Physical barriers** – Use collars around tender stems.  
  - *DIY*: Cut the ends off plastic drink bottles; they’re easy to remove later.
- **Decoy traps** –  
  - Scatter halved citrus fruit (fleshy side down) around veggie patches. Slaters are attracted to the dark, damp underside; you can then collect and dispose of them in bulk.  
  - Fill old food containers with potato peelings or other scraps; they provide a home and food source, drawing slaters away from your crops.
- **Poultry help** – If you have space, keep a couple of chickens. Let them roam empty veggie beds between sowings; they’ll eat slaters and other insects without damaging your crops.
- **Organic snail pellets** – As a last resort, most types of organic snail pellets can reduce slater numbers. *Remember*: even organic pellets can harm other beneficial insects.

## Bottom Line

Individual slaters are harmless and beneficial, but **too many can become a problem** if your garden becomes a perfect habitat. By combining these discouraging tactics, you can maintain a balanced slater population that brings only the good stuff to your garden.
