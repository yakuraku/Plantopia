*Controlling slugs and snails*

## Why Slugs & Snails Are a Problem  
Spring rains and warm nights create the *perfect* conditions for these pests.  
- They **breed rapidly** and can lay dozens of eggs in a single season.  
- A single snail can **devour an entire batch of seedlings** in one night.  
- If left unchecked, you’ll wake up to a garden **decimated** by the time you’re ready to plant.

## What Makes Them Thrive  
- **Moisture**: They need damp soil and shade to stay alive.  
- **Shelter**: Daytime hiding spots like old pots, timber, and tree‑trunk crevices keep them safe from predators.  
- **Food**: Soft‑bodied seedlings, lettuce, and many leafy greens are their favorite.

## Safe & Effective Control Methods  

### 1. Remove Their Hideouts  
- **Clear debris**: Get rid of old pots, wood piles, and any clutter that offers daytime shelter.  
- **Trim tree trunks**: Check for and remove crevices where snails might sleep.  
- *Result*: With fewer hiding places, predators can hunt them more easily and populations stay low.

### 2. Set Up Traps  
You can buy commercial slug & snail traps or DIY them for cheap.

| DIY Trap | How to Build | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Plastic saucer** | Place a saucer 3 cm deep in the soil, rim close to the surface. | Fill half with beer **or** a sugar‑yeast solution. Snails/​slugs are attracted, crawl in, and drown. |
| **Plastic bottle** | Cut the bottle in half, invert it, and bury it so the rim is near the soil. | Same liquid lure; the trap is easy to collect and dispose of. |
| **Damp board** | Leave a damp board out overnight near valuable plants. | Slugs crawl under it at night and can be removed in the morning. |

- **Tip**: Keep one edge slightly raised off the ground; this makes it easier to scoop out the trapped pests.

### 3. Natural Predators & Other Tricks  
- **Ducks**: Excellent at eating slugs and snails; great if you have space for a pond or a small flock.  
- **Crushed eggshells** or **diatomaceous earth**: Sprinkle around plants; the sharp edges deter them.  
- **Garlic spray**: Mix minced garlic with water, strain, and spray on foliage; the scent keeps pests away.  
- *Choose the method that fits your garden’s size, wildlife, and personal comfort with killing.*

### 4. Non‑lethal Barriers  
- **Copper wire or strips**: Place around the base of prized plants.  
- *Why it works*: Slugs and snails dislike the copper’s electrical charge and will avoid crossing it.

### 5. Know Your Snails  
- **Native vs. introduced**:  
  - *Native*: **Two antennae**.  
  - *Introduced (often more destructive)*: **Four antennae**.  
- *Why it matters*: Native species usually pose no threat, so identifying them can prevent unnecessary control measures.

## Bottom Line  
You’ll always lose a few seedlings to slugs and snails, but by **reducing their habitat, using traps, encouraging natural predators, and setting up barriers**, you keep their numbers manageable. The less you have to intervene, the easier it is to enjoy a healthy, thriving garden.
