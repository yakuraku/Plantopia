* A Veggie Gardener's Guide to Cabbage Moths, Butterflies, and Caterpillars  

Gardening isn’t just about the joy of growing; it’s also about protecting what you plant. **Cabbage moths and butterflies are the ultimate brassica‑hunters**—they’ll swoop in, lay eggs, and leave your crops in tatters in no time.

## What Are Cabbage Moths and Butterflies?  

In Australia, two brassica‑loving pests dominate the scene:

| Pest | Scientific name | Size | Appearance |
|------|-----------------|------|------------|
| **Cabbage moth** | *Plutella xylostella* | ~10 mm | Mottled grey with a diamond‑patterned wing |
| **Cabbage white butterfly** | *Pieris rapae* | ~40 mm | White wings with tiny black corner spots |

*Despite their differences, both species share the same habits, cause similar damage, and are managed in comparable ways.*

### The Life Cycle That Lures You In  
- **Adults** are harmless, but they’ll lay eggs on any brassica.  
- **Caterpillars**:  
  - Moth larvae are light greenish‑brown with a darker head.  
  - Butterfly larvae are smooth, greenish‑blue.  
- Once hatched, the larvae **chew a network of holes**, leading to leaf loss, skeletonisation, and eventually plant death.

## Which Plants Are Targets?  

- All brassicas: cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, rocket, and many leafy greens.  
- Even if you can’t identify the species, *any caterpillar on a food crop is a problem*.

## Prevention Strategies  

### 1. Netting  
- **Fine netting** forms a physical barrier, keeping moths out.  
- Ensure the net fully encloses each plant, leaving a small gap to avoid contact.  
- Options: dedicated butterfly‑protection nets, old mosquito nets, or window screens.  
- **Drawback**: If eggs are already laid, the caterpillars can feed freely inside the net.  
- **Tip**: Netting can be a hassle to remove for maintenance.

### 2. Companion Planting  
- **Decoy plants**: nasturtiums, dill, mustard, and especially land cress (a “dead‑end” decoy).  
  - Adults are attracted to land cress, but its leaves are toxic to caterpillars—any eggs laid there won’t survive.  
- **Odour barriers**: plant strong‑smelling herbs (lavender, sage, rosemary) around the patch edges to deter moths without blocking access.

### 3. Decoy Moth “Scarecrows”  
- Moths are territorial; they avoid laying eggs where competition is high.  
- Create simple decoys: cut white plastic sheeting or old shopping bags into rough moth shapes (~40 mm).  
- Attach to twigs or canes near your brassicas.  
- The fluttering in the breeze mimics a rival, encouraging real moths to settle elsewhere.

## Dealing with an Infestation  

When prevention fails, swift action saves your crop.

1. **Manual removal**  
   - Inspect undersides of leaves and plant hearts for caterpillars.  
   - Pick off larvae and discard them.  
   - Repeat daily; remove egg clutches to stop new larvae.  
2. **Water spray**  
   - If handling larvae is tough, use a light hose or garden sprayer to knock them onto the soil.  
   - Ground‑falling caterpillars become easy prey for birds, beetles, and other predators.  
3. **When to use sprays**  
   - Manual methods work for small patches or mild infestations.  
   - For larger or severe problems, consider targeted sprays.

## Anti‑Caterpillar Sprays  

### Commercial Options  
- **Pyrethrum‑based sprays**: effective but can harm beneficial insects like ladybirds.  
- **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) sprays** (e.g., Dipel):  
  - **Highly selective**—targets leaf‑eating caterpillars only.  
  - **Harmless** to birds and wildlife.  
  - **No withholding period** on food crops.  
  - **Organic**—derived from natural sources.  
- **How it works**: Bt acts as a toxin; caterpillars die 2–3 days after ingesting treated leaves.  
- **Application**: mix powder with water per instructions, spray the entire plant. Re‑apply after rain and every few days as sunlight breaks down the bacteria.

### Homemade Spray  
- Mix equal parts white flour and boiling water into a smooth paste.  
- Dilute with cold water to create a sprayable liquid.  
- Apply to affected leaves; as it dries, the flour “glues” and suffocates caterpillars.  
- **Caution**: While chemical‑free, it can still affect beneficial insects—use sparingly.

## Other Integrated Solutions  

A multi‑front approach ensures long‑term success:

- **Attract predators**: grow blooming herbs and flowers to invite wasps, ladybirds, and other beneficial insects.  
- **Winter tillage**: dig over beds to expose dormant pupae to hungry birds.  
- **Living mulch**: plant white clover around brassicas; its white flowers act like plastic decoys, and its fragrance masks the brassica scent.  
- **Egg shell scatter**: spread broken white eggshells on soil—another territorial deterrent.  

## Bottom Line  

Adult butterflies and moths are generally harmless and even beneficial. Their hungry young, however, can devastate your brassicas. By combining **netting, companion planting, decoy moths, manual removal, and targeted sprays**, you’ll keep your crops healthy and thriving.
