# Earwig, Friend or Foe? – Why the Earwig’s Reputation as a Pest is Exaggerated

## About the Earwig  

- **85 species in Australia** – a mix of native and introduced types.  
- Size ranges from **~12 mm** up to **double that** in the largest species.  
- **Signature feature:** a pair of pincers (forceps) at the rear, balanced by long, segmented antennae.  
  - *Males* have larger, curved pincers; *females* have shorter, straighter ones.  
- Despite their “alien” look, earwigs are **almost entirely harmless** to humans.  
  - Myths about them crawling into ears are **false**.  
  - Some species can release a foul‑smelling liquid as a defense—unpleasant, not toxic.  
  - Only the biggest specimens might give a gentle nip when extremely provoked.  
- **Behavior:**  
  - Mostly **nocturnal**, preferring damp, dark spots.  
  - Common hiding places: rotting wood piles, under containers, leaf litter, etc.  
  - Though they have wings, they rarely fly if a shaded spot is available.

## Hunters and Scavengers  

Earwigs are **opportunistic**—they’ll eat almost anything, which makes them valuable allies:

- **Scavengers**: recycle organic debris into fertile soil.  
- **Pollinators**: forage pollen at night, aiding plant reproduction.  
- **Predators**:  
  - Target aphids, juvenile snails, and other garden pests.  
  - Attack larvae of the codling moth (a major threat to pears, apples, and other fruits).  
- **Food source** for birds, amphibians, reptiles, and even domestic poultry.  

In short, they help keep the garden ecosystem **balanced and healthy**.

## The Problems They Cause  

While earwigs bring many benefits, they can also be a nuisance:

- **Ripe fruit damage**: they nibble on fruit, causing cosmetic blemishes (rarely total loss).  
- **Leaf damage**:  
  - Chew ragged holes in herbs and soft‑leaf plants.  
  - May shred growing tips or, in extreme cases, strip foliage from small seedlings.  
- **Infestations** are uncommon under normal conditions but can spike in **damp, cool years** or in **monoculture** settings with few predators.

## Handling an Infestation  

If earwig numbers start to outweigh their benefits, try these practical, low‑impact methods:

### 1. Remove Attractive Habitats  

- Keep **rotting wood** and **leaf piles** away from vulnerable plants.  
- Clear debris that offers dark, damp hiding spots.

### 2. Newspaper Traps  

1. Lightly dampen a sheet of newspaper.  
2. Roll into a hollow tube and secure with string.  
3. Place near target plants; earwigs will seek the dark refuge.  
4. When they’re inside, remove the tube and dump the contents in the compost bin or discard.

*Great for targeted removal without harming the overall earwig population.*

### 3. Corrugated Cardboard Traps  

- Roll up corrugated cardboard into tubes (like a “bee hotel”).  
- Attach to fruit tree branches to catch earwigs before they damage fruit.  
- Replace weekly; dispose of captured earwigs as desired.

### 4. Oil Pit Traps  

1. Take a small container with a lid.  
2. Half‑fill with cooking oil + a splash of soy sauce (for scent).  
3. Cut a small entry hole in the lid, seal the container, and bury it so the lid sits level with the soil.  
4. Earwigs enter the oil and cannot escape—**selective and lethal**.  
5. (Can also use slug/snail traps for this method.)

### 5. Sticky Traps  

- Spread a gluey substance (e.g., Vaseline) on thick cardboard.  
- Add a little sugar as bait.  
- Place around attacked plants.  
- Earwigs (and other insects) get stuck.  
- *Caution:* may trap beneficial insects like ladybirds; use sparingly.

### 6. Diatomaceous Earth  

- Sprinkle around plant bases.  
- Forms a sharp, non‑toxic barrier that deters earwigs and other insects.  
- Reapply regularly, especially after rain, as it becomes damp and loses potency.

### 7. Insecticides  

- Use only as a **last resort**.  
- Choose **plant‑derived** products over synthetic ones to minimize harm to beneficial insects.  
- These break down faster and reduce environmental impact.

## Bottom Line  

Earwigs are **mostly benign and often beneficial**. Unless you’re dealing with a serious infestation that truly harms your plants, a **“live and let live”** approach is usually best. When action is needed, the methods above provide practical, eco‑friendly options to keep earwigs in check while preserving the health of your garden ecosystem.
