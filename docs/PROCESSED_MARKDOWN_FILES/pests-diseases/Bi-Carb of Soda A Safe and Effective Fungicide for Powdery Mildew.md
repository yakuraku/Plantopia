## What Is Powdery Mildew?

Powdery mildew is a common fungal problem that loves **damp, humid spots** with **poor airflow**. It shows up as a white, powdery coating on leaves, interfering with photosynthesis and gradually sapping a plant’s health and vigor. Even a mild infection can make plants look dull and reduce yields; left unchecked, it can kill the plant entirely. **Act early** to keep your garden thriving.

## Cultural Practices: The First Line of Defense

- **Sunlight** – Ensure plants receive plenty of bright, indirect light.  
- **Watering** – Water at the base, avoid wetting foliage, and allow leaves to dry quickly.  
- **Air circulation** – Space plants adequately and prune to improve airflow.  
- **Soil quality** – Well‑drained, slightly acidic to neutral soil helps resist mildew.

## Commercial Fungicides: Pros & Cons

While many gardeners turn to commercial sprays, there are several drawbacks:

| Issue | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| **Not fully organic** | Many contain synthetic chemicals that some gardeners wish to avoid. |
| **Human & animal toxicity** | Can be hazardous in a domestic garden, especially around pets and children. |
| **Bee toxicity** | Some fungicides are harmful to pollinators, adding stress to already‑weakened bee populations. |

If you’re looking for a gentler, more natural option, consider baking soda.

## How to Make a Baking Soda Anti‑Fungal Spray

1. **Mix**  
   - 1 teaspoon baking soda  
   - 1 liter (≈4 cups) water  
   - A few drops of **liquid hand soap** (not laundry detergent) to help the solution cling to leaves.

2. **Shake** well in a garden sprayer or mister.

3. **Apply**  
   - Spray liberally over affected plants.  
   - Do this on a **cool morning** when the plant isn’t in direct sun to avoid leaf scorching.  
   - **Never spray in the evening**; damp leaves overnight can worsen fungal problems.

## Are There Any Drawbacks?

- **Concentration matters** – A too‑strong spray can scorch leaves, causing yellowing or curling.  
- **Soil pH buildup** – Repeated use can raise pH, especially in containers, locking up nutrients.  
  - *Tip:* If you use the spray on potted plants, replace the compost before the next season to restore neutral pH.  
- **Effectiveness** – Baking soda is milder than commercial fungicides. For severe outbreaks, a dedicated mildew fungicide may still be necessary.

---

**Bottom line:** If powdery mildew is a frequent nuisance, a mild baking soda spray can slow fungal growth and give your plants a fighting chance—especially during damp periods of the growing season.
