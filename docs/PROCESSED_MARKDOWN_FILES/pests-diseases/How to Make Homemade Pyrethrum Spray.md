## Why Homemade Pyrethrum?  
Gardening without pesticides is a noble goal, but a single aphid outbreak can wipe out weeks of work.  
**Pyrethrum** gives you a *fully organic* insecticide that:

- Kills aphids, caterpillars, and most soft‑bodied bugs  
- Breaks down in a few days, leaving no lasting residue  
- Is made from plants you grow yourself

## Step‑by‑Step: Making the Spray

1. **Harvest the Flowers**  
   - Cut whole heads when fully bloomed.  
   - Hang them in a cool, dark spot until completely dry.  
   - Store in an airtight container (or freezer) to keep potency for up to 6 months.

2. **Prepare the Powder**  
   - Grind the dried heads into a fine powder.  
   - Wear gloves and a mask if you’re sensitive to pollen.

3. **Mix the Solution**  
   - Combine ½ cup powder with 10 ml liquid soap.  
   - Add 1 L water and stir until smooth.  
   - Transfer to a garden sprayer.

4. **Apply**  
   - Spray directly onto infested areas.  
   - Use a light hand; the toxin works instantly.  
   - Re‑apply after a few days if needed.

## Quick‑Fix Method (Fresh Blooms)

If you need a spray right away:

1. **Soak**  
   - Mix 250 g fresh flowers with 30 ml 70 % isopropyl alcohol.  
   - Let sit overnight.

2. **Strain**  
   - Filter through muslin or a clean cloth.

3. **Dilute**  
   - Mix the extract with cold water to achieve a ¼‑strength solution.

4. **Spray**  
   - Use immediately; the solution will degrade quickly.

## Growing Your Own Pyrethrum

| Step | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Planting** | Sunny spot, moist but well‑draining soil. |
| **Seeds** | Sow 4 mm deep, 35 cm apart (direct or as seedlings). |
| **Containers** | Minimum 30 cm across. |
| **Germination** | 7–10 days. |
| **Maturity** | ~4 months. |
| **Encourage Growth** | Pinch early buds; remove flowers after peak bloom to extend flowering. |

*Alternative plant:* **Painted Daisy** (*Tanacetum coccineum*) – colorful but lower toxin levels.

## Safety & Best Practices

- **Use Quickly** – Sunlight degrades the spray in days.  
- **Harvest Timing** – Wait up to a week before picking veggies; wash thoroughly.  
- **Protect Yourself** – Mask, gloves, and avoid spraying near children/pets.  
- **Targeted Application** – Spray only on infested spots; avoid beneficial insects.  
- **Cover Plants** – Netting can keep pollinators safe until the toxin fades.  
- **Re‑apply if Needed** – A second spray a few days later often finishes the job.
