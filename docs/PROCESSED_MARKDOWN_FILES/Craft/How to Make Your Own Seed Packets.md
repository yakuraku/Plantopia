2. **Print the design**  
   • Print directly onto the paper you want to use.  
   • Or print once on plain paper, then trace the outline onto sturdy card to create a reusable template.

3. **Cut and outline**  
   • Carefully cut along the outer borders.  
   • Lightly pencil the inner rectangle if you need a reference.

4. **Fold the flaps**  
   • Fold the four flaps inward along the rectangle lines.  
   • Crease firmly, then fold the flaps back out.

5. **Create the pocket**  
   • Fold the largest flap inward to form the back of the envelope.  
   • Apply glue (a glue stick works best) to the narrow side and bottom flaps, fold them in, and press to form a pocket.

6. **Let it dry**  
   • Allow the glue to set before filling the packet with seeds.

7. **Seal or store**  
   • Fold the top flap down to close the packet if you’ll use the seeds soon.  
   • For long‑term storage, glue the flap in place.

> **Tip:** Let the seals dry completely before adding seeds to avoid smudging.

## Creative Customization Ideas

- **Paper choice** – Use colorful gift‑wrapping paper, recycled magazine pages, or textured cardstock for a unique look.  
- **Personal touches** – Add designs, text, or logos before printing for personalized gifts or branded packets.  
- **Post‑printing décor** – After the packet is made, decorate with ink stamps, stickers, glitter, or hand‑drawn motifs—great for a family craft session.  
- **Resize with software** – Use graphics software to scale the template for tiny or large packets.  
- **Multi‑use designs** – Larger packets can neatly store plant ties, row markers, or labels.
