Sowing seeds doesn’t always have to be a meticulous science. When you’re working with lots of tiny seeds—think wildflowers—sometimes a playful, hands‑on approach works best. DIY seed *bombs* let you do just that: they’re a fun, low‑maintenance way to re‑seed large areas or start a pot of plants, and they’re perfect for a school‑holiday project or an eco‑friendly gift.

## What Exactly Are Seed Bombs?

Despite the dramatic name, seed bombs are simply **marble‑sized balls of clay** that contain a handful of seeds.  
- They protect seeds from hungry wildlife.  
- The clay buffers against temperature extremes.  
- The weight keeps them from blowing away.  
- When rain “explodes” the bomb, the clay‑soil mix gives seeds the ideal start for germination.

## Which Seeds Are Best for DIY Bombs?

Because seed bombs are a *hands‑off* method, choose seeds that:
- **Germinate easily** on their own.  
- Are **small enough** not to be damaged when the clay is rolled.

Some top picks:

- **Meadow mix**: cosmos, zinnia, alyssum, linaria, California poppies, nigella  
- **Herb & veggie mix**: dill, rocket, mustard, radish  

Seed bombs are also a great way to use up leftover seed packets that would otherwise sit idle.

## Making DIY Seed Bombs: What You’ll Need

| Ingredient | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| Seeds | ¼–¾ cup |
| Seed‑raising mix or fine, sterile soil | ¾ cup |
| Clay (powdered from a pottery shop, air‑drying modelling clay, or garden clay) | 2 cups |
| Plain water | ½–¾ cup |

**Extras**  
- A suitable mixing container  
- Wire rack or cardboard sheets for drying  
- Small cardboard box for storage  

> **Note:** If you’re using garden clay, pick a **heavy, fine‑grained** type. Make sure it’s free of large particles or weed seeds, and dry it as much as possible before use.

## DIY Seed Bombs Method

1. **Mix** the soil, clay, and seeds with a little over half the water to form a dough. Knead gently until smooth—aim for a *modeling‑clay* texture. Add water a splash at a time if the mix feels too stiff.  
2. **Shape** the dough into marble‑sized balls. If the mixture flakes, moisten your hands or add a touch more water. Keep the dough from becoming mushy.  
3. **Dry** the balls on a wire rack or cardboard sheet in a cool, shady spot for 1–2 days.  
4. **Store** the finished bombs in the cardboard box until you’re ready to plant.

## Using Your DIY Seed Bombs

- **Scatter** the bombs over the area you want to reseed and let the rain do the rest.  
- For a bit more control, **place** the bombs directly on soil or compost pots and gently water them to start germination.

**Tip:** Use the bombs within six months. If they get damp before you’re ready, you might see shoots appear earlier than desired.
