Add a touch of natural beauty to your front door this Christmas with a unique and sustainable homemade foliage wreath. Wreaths are easy to craft with commonly grown (or responsibly foraged) branches and can be as simple or as ornate as you like—your only limit is your imagination!

## Materials

- **Wreath base** (20 cm – 40 cm diameter)  
- **40 cm of string or ribbon** for the hanging loop  
- **Florist’s wire, strong thread, or twine**  
- A *variety of foliage*  
- **Dried seed pods, pine cones, ribbons, or other decorations**

> *Tip:* Choose foliage that holds its shape well and can stay out of water for a couple of weeks without wilting.  
> *Best options:* Conifer branches, bay laurel, banksia, eucalyptus, buxus (box), and rosemary.  
> *Hot‑climate note:* Dried foliage and flowers last longer than fresh leaves, which may wilt in a few days.  
> *Mix it up:* Include dried branches, twigs, flowers, and grasses. Pick different sizes, colors, and textures to suit your desired look.

## Method

1. **Attach the hanging loop**  
   - Secure a 40 cm string or ribbon to the back of the wreath base.  
   - This will be used to hang the finished wreath.

2. **Prepare the base**  
   - Place the wreath base flat on a work surface.  
   - Attach florist’s wire or thread to the hoop for later use.

3. **Trim the foliage**  
   - Cut branches to a *uniform length* (20–30 cm works well).  
   - Test a few lengths on the hoop to see what looks best.

4. **Clean the stems**  
   - Remove lower leaves so each branch has 5–10 cm of bare stem.

5. **Create small bunches**  
   - Gather 2–3 branches, bundle them, and place on the hoop with ends facing slightly outward.

6. **Secure the first bunch**  
   - Wrap florist’s wire or thread firmly around the hoop several times.

7. **Add the next bundle**  
   - Place it so it overlaps the first, with ends facing slightly inward.  
   - Secure with wire or thread as before.

8. **Continue around the hoop**  
   - Alternate inward and outward facing bunches until the entire hoop is covered.

9. **Finish the circle**  
   - Tuck the last group of branches behind the first to close the loop.

10. **Attach decorations**  
    - Use wire or thread to add seed pods, pine cones, ribbons, or other ornaments.

> *Storage tip:* Wreaths last longer when kept out of heat and direct sun. In an Australian summer, hang the wreath in a shady spot or indoors facing a window so it can still be admired from the street.

## Responsible Disposal

- **Unravel the wire** and place the foliage in the compost bin or council green waste.  
- Keep the wire, decorations, and wreath base for reuse next year.

Enjoy your fresh, eco‑friendly holiday décor!
