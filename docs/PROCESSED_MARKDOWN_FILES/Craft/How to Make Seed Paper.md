Seed paper is a creative, eco‑conscious way to turn paper waste into living gifts. Use it for cards, gift tags, or event keepsakes, and it’s a fun craft for kids to learn about recycling. Let’s dive in!

## What Is Seed Paper?

Seed paper is handmade paper that contains tiny seeds. Once planted in soil and watered, the seeds germinate, turning the paper into a growing plant. It’s a *double whammy* of sustainability: reusing waste paper and giving a purpose to excess seeds while encouraging people to nurture life.

- **Professional seed paper** uses fine pulp dried between screens, yielding a smooth surface that’s even *write‑on‑able*.
- Our method uses everyday household items, making it perfect for children and producing a rustic finish ideal for swing tags, cards, or labels.

## Selecting the Paper and Seeds

You don’t need fancy paper—just recyclable, non‑glossy scraps:

- Old newspapers
- Schoolwork
- Egg cartons
- Shredded paper

*Tip:* The paper’s color and any printed ink will show through the finished seed paper, so choose supplies that match your desired look.

When picking seeds, aim for small, hard varieties that germinate easily:

- Herbs: **basil**, **chamomile**
- Flowers: **forget‑me‑not**, **brachyscome**

These seeds stay attached to the paper without swelling, making them ideal for beginners.

## How to Make Seed Paper

### Materials

- Scrap paper
- Water
- Seeds

### Equipment

- Blender
- Splatter guard or old window screen
- Cookie cutters (optional)
- Old towel
- Cloth or cotton fabric

### Method

*Paper making can be messy—work outdoors or in a spill‑ready area.*

1. **Tear or cut** paper into small pieces and place them in a bowl. Smaller pieces give a smoother finish.  
   *2 cups of tightly packed shredded paper* is plenty for a first batch.

2. **Soak** the paper overnight. Stir occasionally to help it break down. It should become soft and mushy.

3. **Drain** excess water and transfer the pulp to a blender. Add an equal volume of water and blend.  
   *Add more water a little at a time* until you reach a thick‑custard‑like consistency—just enough to spread when spooned.

4. **Set up** the splatter guard on a flat surface over a folded old towel (the towel will absorb excess water).

   - *With cookie cutters:* Place cutters on the guard, spoon pulp into each, and press evenly with fingers.
   - *For a sheet:* Spoon pulp directly onto the guard and press into an even layer with fingers or a spoon’s back.

5. **Press** the pulp with a cloth or fabric to remove excess water. The towel will soak it up quickly. If the paper tears, add a bit more pulp to patch it.

6. **Sprinkle** seeds lightly over the pulp and gently press them into the surface with fingers or a dry cloth.

7. **Batch work**: If making large quantities, work in batches. When a sheet is partially dry, flip the guard and press to release the paper onto the towel, freeing the guard for the next batch.

8. **Dry** the seed paper for 1–2 days. Ensure it’s completely dry before the next step—otherwise the seeds may germinate prematurely.  
   *A fan on low speed or a cool hair dryer* can speed up drying if the weather isn’t ideal.

9. **Trim** and shape the dried paper. For gift tags, punch a hole. Add growing instructions (see below).

### How to Plant Your Seed Paper

1. Fill a small pot with potting mix, leaving about **5 cm** below the rim.
2. Place the seed paper on the soil surface and cover with **1 cm** of soil.
3. Water thoroughly.
4. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings emerge, then move the pot to a sunny spot.
