Kids love a good mess, and homemade slime is the ultimate sensory playground. But what if the slime is **edible, safe, and even nutritious**? This recipe uses chia or basil seeds—naturally gelatinous when soaked—to create a slime that’s perfect for playtime and a tasty snack afterward.  

## Ingredients  
- **2 Tbsp chia seeds** (or basil seeds)  
- **125 g cornflour** (≈ ¾ cup) – add more if needed  
- **250 ml water**  
- Food colouring and/or flavouring drops (optional)  

You’ll also need:  
- A large mixing bowl with a sealable lid  
- A fork or spatula  
- 4 hours (or overnight) for soaking the seeds  

## Method  

1. **Soak the seeds**  
   - Add the chia seeds and water to the bowl.  
   - Stir well, seal, and refrigerate.  
   - After **1 hour**, stir again to prevent clumping, reseal, and let sit for another **3 hours** or overnight.  

2. **Check the consistency**  
   - The mixture should be sticky and gelatinous, still with some liquid.  
   - If clumps persist, mix in **1 tsp xanthan gum** to disperse them.  

3. **Add the cornflour**  
   - Gradually fold in the cornflour with the fork or spatula.  
   - The mixture will slowly thicken and begin to come together.  

4. **Colour & flavour** (optional)  
   - Add a few drops of food colouring or flavouring.  
   - Use a light touch—too much dye can stain everything!  
   - If you want two colours, split the batch before adding dye.  

5. **Knead the slime**  
   - Transfer the mixture onto a floured surface.  
   - Knead by hand until it forms a smooth ball.  
   - If it remains sticky, add cornflour **spoonful by spoonful** until it’s stretchy and pliable.  

6. **Adjust if needed**  
   - Too much cornflour → brittle and flaky.  
   - Remedy: wet your hands and knead again; a little moisture restores stretchiness.  

## What to Do With the Slime  

- **Sensory play**: Kids can stretch, shape, squash, and mould the slime for hours, boosting motor skills and calming frayed nerves.  
- **Edible & nutritious**: No safety worries—just a tasty treat.  
- **Storage**: Keep in the fridge when not in use; discard after ~4 days.  
- **Eco‑friendly**: Fully biodegradable—compost or plant it in your garden.  
- **Re‑hydrate**: If it dries out, wet your hands for a minute or two and knead; it’ll return to its stretchy glory.
