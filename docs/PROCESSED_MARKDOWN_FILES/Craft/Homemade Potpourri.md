## What is Potpourri?

Potpourri is a **blend of dried flowers, petals, leaves, and other botanicals** that serves as a decorative, natural air‑freshener.  
While you can buy ready‑made mixes, crafting your own is **fun, thrifty, and a satisfying way to reuse garden blooms** that are starting to fade.

## Typical Potpourri Ingredients

Traditionally, potpourri starts with dried rose petals, but you can mix in any fragrant flowers you have on hand.  
Here are some great alternatives if you’re not a rose‑grower:

- **Sweet Alyssum**  
- **Calendula**  
- **Carnations**  
- **Stock**  
- **Lavender**  
- **Sweet William**

*Whichever flowers you choose, aim for a good mix of highly scented varieties along with a range of colours, textures, and shapes.*

## Unconventional Ingredients

Commercial potpourris usually focus on fragrant blooms, but your own blend lets you experiment:

- Apple blossom (from fruit trees)  
- Flowers from abundant vegetables like beans or zucchini  
- Shop‑bought bouquets as they start to wilt and fade  

Once you know the basics, **the possibilities are endless**.

## Optional Essential Oils

If your base ingredients aren’t strong enough, add a few drops of essential oil:

- Sandalwood  
- Lavender  
- Rose  

*Adding oils is optional, but if you do, pair them with a fragrance‑fixing material* (angelica root, oakmoss, or orris root) to keep the scent from evaporating quickly.  
You can find these fixers at craft stores or health‑food shops.

**Caution:** Essential oils can easily overpower the natural fragrances, giving an artificial note that defeats the purpose.

## Embellishments and Extras

Beyond petals and oils, you can decorate or enhance the scent with:

- Thick aromatic leaves that hold their shape after drying  
- Whole spices: cloves, cinnamon sticks, star anise  
- Dried berries, seed pods, tree bark, small pine cones  
- Decorative items: old keys, coins, small pebbles, feathers

## The Basic Potpourri Method

1. **Preheat** your oven to a maximum of **90 °C**.  
2. If using an essential oil, **dilute it lightly with water**, spray the mixture over the fixer, and let it steep.  
3. **Remove** the tray and let the mixture **cool** on the tray.  
4. Transfer the finished blend to decorative bowls, or fill fabric sachets or parcels.

*Traditionally, ingredients were left to air‑dry on racks in a warm, well‑ventilated spot, but the oven method is quicker and more reliable.*

## Potpourri Tips & Tricks

- **Avoid metal bowls or utensils** when preparing potpourri; they can react chemically and spoil the fragrance.  
- **Plastic bowls** are fine, but they may retain scents for months—don’t use your favourite cooking or cake‑making equipment.  
- Use potpourri immediately, or **seal it in a cool, dark place** to mature for a month or more, which smooths and intensifies the fragrance.  
- If you’ve used an essential oil, **spray stale potpourri with a light solution of the same oil** to revive it.  
- Hang a sachet above your shower to release refreshing vapours in the steam—perfect for a morning wake‑up.
