## The Best Herbs to Grow Indoors

Most indoor‑friendly herbs have **deep green, soft leaves** and **tender stems**.  
Here are the top picks:

- **Basil** – classic kitchen staple  
- **Chives** – subtle onion flavour  
- **Parsley** – versatile and nutritious  
- **Lemon balm** – citrusy aroma  
- **Cress** – tiny, peppery leaves  
- **Mint** – easy to grow, great for drinks  
- **Perilla** – adds a unique, mint‑like taste  
- **Chervil** – delicate, parsley‑like  
- **Cat grass** – keeps your feline friends happy  

*Sun‑loving Mediterranean herbs* such as **rosemary, oregano, and thyme** need strong, direct sunlight and are best grown outdoors.

If you want to expand beyond herbs, try **leafy green vegetables** that thrive in similar conditions:

- Pak choi  
- Rocket (arugula)  
- Loose‑leaf lettuce  
- Mizuna  

These will give you fresh salad leaves and stir‑fry ingredients right at home.

## Light: The More the Better

The most critical factor for indoor herb success is **light**.

- Aim for a spot that receives **direct sunlight for at least 3 hours a day** (ideally 6).  
- A **north‑facing windowsill** offers the most consistent light; an **east‑facing sill** catching morning sun is the next best option.  

If natural light is insufficient, supplement with **UV grow lamps**.  
These are affordable, easy to find, and can replicate the light intensity and frequency that plants need.

## Water, Water Everywhere

Watering is the second most important element after lighting.

1. **Use pots with drainage holes** to let excess water escape.  
2. **Water every few days**, checking the top 3–5 cm of soil.  
3. **Test with your index finger**:  
   - If the soil feels *slightly moist* after a 5 cm poke, it’s time to water.  
   - If it comes out *wet and dirty*, hold off for a day or two.  

Too much or too little water can both kill your herbs, so keep a steady, moderate schedule.

## Feeding: Little by Little

Indoor herbs can’t tap into garden soil nutrients, so a gentle feeding routine keeps them strong.

- **Feed once every 2 weeks to once a month**.  
- **Dilute the fertilizer** to **¼–½ the strength** recommended for garden plants.  
- Over‑fertilizing builds salt in the pot pores, which can harm plants.  
- After each feed, water with plain water to flush out excess nutrients.

## Time to Harvest

Harvesting is where the real joy begins. Proper technique keeps your plants healthy and productive.

1. Use **sharp scissors or gardening snips**.  
2. **Snip stems** down to a few leaf junctions *above the soil*, leaving healthy growth.  
3. For **parsley** (no central stalk), cut the outermost leaves at the base, leaving at least **three central leaves**.  
4. **Never harvest more than 25 % of a plant at once**—over‑harvesting can stress the plant.

Regular harvesting encourages new shoots and keeps the plant bushy and flavorful.
