## What Is a Herb Spiral?

Herb spirals are a **raised garden bed** shaped like a spiral.  
- The **center is higher** than the outer layers, which slope down to ground level.  
- One side receives **full sun**, while the opposite side stays **shaded and protected**.  
- Water naturally **drains from the top to the bottom**, often into a small pond or swale, creating distinct moisture zones.  
- Build them from **stone, bricks, or timber**—any natural material that fits your style.

## Why Build One?

Herb spirals let you grow **many different herbs in one compact space** by creating multiple micro‑climates.  
- **Dry‑tolerant herbs** (e.g., rosemary) thrive on the **north‑facing, higher** part of the spiral.  
- **Moisture‑loving herbs** (e.g., mint) do best on the **south‑facing, lower** side.  
- The vertical design keeps all plants **easily reachable** for harvesting.  
- They’re especially handy for **small gardens** and can be built on a budget if you repurpose materials.

## Materials & Design

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Base layer** (brick, stone, timber) | Forms the spiral shape |
| **Gravel or scoria** | Improves drainage at the bottom |
| **Swale or small pond** (optional) | Captures excess water |
| **Good quality soil + compost** | Provides nutrients |
| **Organic mulch** (lucerne or sugar cane) | Retains moisture and suppresses weeds |

**Size tip:** A spiral **1.5 m wide × 1 m high** balances space and ease of maintenance.

## Step‑by‑Step Build Guide

1. **Pick a sunny spot** – most herbs need at least **6 hours of sunlight** per day.  
2. **Prepare the ground**  
   - Dig out weeds and level the area.  
   - If building on lawn, lay a thick sheet of cardboard to smother weeds.  
3. **Lay the first layer**  
   - Use a single layer of your chosen material to outline the spiral.  
   - Ensure the **outer end faces south** to create a shady, moist micro‑climate.  
4. **Add successive layers**  
   - Build up the height gradually toward the center.  
5. **Improve drainage**  
   - Place a layer of **gravel or scoria** at the base.  
   - If desired, dig a **swale or small pond** lined with pebbles at the bottom to capture runoff.  
6. **Fill with soil**  
   - Use a mix of **good quality soil and compost** for fertility.  
7. **Plant**  
   - Sow or transplant seedlings according to each herb’s preferred micro‑climate.  
   - *Example:* Rosemary on the dry, sunny side; mint on the shaded, moist side.  
8. **Water**  
   - Water well, allowing excess to flow into the swale or pond.  
9. **Mulch**  
   - Add **lucerne or sugar cane mulch** to keep moisture in and weeds out.

## Planting & Care Tips

- **Water deeply** but let the soil dry slightly between sessions; the spiral’s drainage helps prevent overwatering.  
- **Rotate crops** every few seasons to keep the soil healthy.  
- **Prune regularly** to encourage bushier growth and prevent overcrowding.  
- **Harvest** from the outer layers first to keep the center accessible.

By following these simple steps, you’ll enjoy a **compact, efficient herb garden** that delivers fresh, flavorful herbs right at your fingertips.
