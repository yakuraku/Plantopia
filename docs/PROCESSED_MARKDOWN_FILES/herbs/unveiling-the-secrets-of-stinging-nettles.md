**What Are Stinging Nettles?**  
Stinging nettle (*Urtica dioica*) is a perennial herb that can be found across Europe, North America, Asia, and Northern Africa. It spreads by seed and underground rhizomes, producing upright stems that can reach **1 m or more**. The soft, serrated green leaves and stems are covered with fine hairs (trichomes) that inject histamine and other chemicals when touched, causing a painful sting that can last for hours. **But those same hairs are neutralised by washing and cooking**.

*Historical tidbits:*  
- First documented use dates back to **3000 BCE**.  
- In **50 BCE** Julius Caesar’s troops reportedly used nettles to stay awake during night shifts.  
- Nettles were once an alternative to flax for making threads, textiles, and cords.  

Today, nettles are prized for their **nutritional, medicinal, and culinary** benefits, and they also help attract pollinators, speed up composting, and make a nutrient‑rich compost tea.
