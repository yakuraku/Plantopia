6. **Seal** and store in a cool, dark place for **2 weeks**.
7. **Taste** after 2 weeks. If the flavor is weak, add more herbs.
8. **Let sit** for an additional week.
9. **Strain** to remove solids (or leave them in for a stronger infusion).
10. **Transfer** to a fresh sterilized jar or keep in the original jar for continued flavor development.
