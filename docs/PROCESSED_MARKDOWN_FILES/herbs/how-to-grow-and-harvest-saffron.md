# Saffron: A Tiny Treasure for Your Garden  

Saffron has been prized in Mediterranean and Indian kitchens for centuries, adding a **distinctive color** and an **earthy, floral flavor** to dishes. It comes from the stigmas of *Crocus sativus*, and because it takes about **170 flowers for just one gram**, it’s often called the most expensive spice on Earth.  

For home gardeners, the good news is that **just a handful of flowers** can give you enough saffron to experiment with in a few recipes. Below is a step‑by‑step guide to growing, harvesting, and using saffron right from your own garden.

## Growing Saffron Crocus

### Climate & Soil

- **Ideal climates**: cold winters, arid or temperate zones with regular frosts.  
- **Not suitable** for subtropical or tropical regions—warm weather prevents flowering.  

### Preparation

1. **Choose a sunny spot**: at least **6 hours of full sun** per day.  
2. **Soil**: loose, well‑drained.  
3. **Add organic matter** (compost, aged manure) **2–3 weeks before planting**.  
4. **Keep weeds out** until you plant the corms.  

> *Tip*: If you prefer containers, use a pot **≥ 20 L** with fresh potting mix plus a slow‑release fertilizer.

### Planting the Corms

| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Timing** | Late summer or early autumn for a late‑autumn bloom. |
| **Spacing** | 10–15 cm between corms. |
| **Depth** | 10 cm deep, pointed tip up. |
| **Watering** | Water well after planting; keep soil moist but not soggy until shoots appear. |

### Cultivation

- **After leaf emergence**: water when the soil is dry **≈ 5 cm below the surface**.  
- **Pests**: generally pest‑free; watch for slugs and snails that may nibble new shoots.  
- **Post‑flowering care**:  
  - Fertilize with **blood & bone** or **pelletised chicken manure**.  
  - Let foliage **die down naturally** to feed the bulb for next season.  
  - Once leaves are gone, cut them at ground level.  
- **Long‑term**: corms can stay in the ground for years.  
- **Summer protection**: mulch heavily with **lucerne or pea straw** to shield from heat.

## Harvesting & Drying Saffron

### What You Need

- **Three bright red stigmas** (the “threads”) from each flower.

### Harvesting Methods

| Method | How to Do It | When |
|--------|--------------|------|
| **In situ** | Remove stigmas directly from the flower, leaving petals intact. | Early morning, just as the flower opens. |
| **Whole‑flower** | Pick the entire flower, then detach stigmas. | Preferred for most gardeners because flowers bloom close to the soil. |

**Steps for whole‑flower harvest**:

1. Pick flowers early in the morning.  
2. Gently peel back petals.  
3. Pinch off the three red stigmas at the base with fingers or tweezers.

### Drying the Threads

- **Dehydrator**: low setting.  
- **Oven**: 75 °C for a short time (≈ 10–15 min).  
- **Air‑dry**: lay on a paper towel for **3–5 days**.  

**Storage**: place dried threads in an airtight jar or container, keep in a dark place. They’ll stay good for **12 months or more**.

## Cooking with Saffron

### Why a Little Goes Far

Because saffron is so concentrated, a pinch can color and flavor a dish beautifully.

### Classic Dishes

- **Spanish paella**  
- **Provencal bouillabaisse** (fish stew)  
- **Indian curries** and **saffron rice**  
- **Risotto**, **tagines**, **tea**, and even **cocktails**

### How to Use

1. **Soak** 1–2 Tbsp of dried threads in water for **≈ 30 min**.  
2. **Add** the threads and the infused water to your dish, or strain out the threads and use only the liquid.  
3. **Avoid over‑use**: too much can bring a bitter edge that masks the spice’s floral notes.
