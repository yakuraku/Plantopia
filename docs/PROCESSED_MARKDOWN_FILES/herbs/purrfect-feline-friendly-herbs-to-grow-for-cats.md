**Why Cats Love Greenery**  
Cats are famously carnivorous, yet most felines enjoy nibbling on grass and other plants.  
* Eating plants adds nutrients and vitamins that are scarce in meat.  
* Chewing and regurgitating grass can help expel hairballs, worms, and other parasites.  
* It gives indoor cats a natural outlet for play and exploration.  

Providing a safe, edible green supply is especially important for house‑bound cats that can’t roam outdoors. Below are the best herbs to grow, a few extra favorites, and the plants you should keep away.

## Three Purrfect Herbs for Cats

| Herb | Why It’s Great | Growing Tips |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Cat Grass (Dactylis glomerata)** | Tough, chew‑friendly, fast indoor grower | Grow in pots or trays; keep in bright light; protect from curious kitties until the plants are sturdy. Avoid planting in open soil to prevent invasiveness. |
| **Barley (Hordeum vulgare)** | Nutrient‑rich, supports overall health | Plant in well‑drained soil; prefers full sun. |
| **Wheatgrass (Triticum aestivum)** | Common wheat; high in fibre | Sow in shallow trays; keep moist until germination. |
| **Oat Grass (Avena sativa)** | Flavourful, high in protein & fibre | Grow in pots; needs moderate light. |

> **Tip:** Use a shallow tray so your cat can easily reach the grass without digging through soil.

### Catnip ( *Nepteta cataria* )
A classic feline stimulant—some cats go wild, others stay indifferent.  
* **Growing:** Mint‑family plant; thrives in full or partial shade.  
* **Benefits:** Besides the “cat‑nip high,” it’s also edible for humans (see our full article on culinary and medicinal uses).  

### Catmint ( *Nepteta mussinii* )
Close relative of catnip with *less* stimulant effect, but *more* ornamental charm.  
* **Features:** Lavender‑blue flowers, striking grey‑green foliage.  
* **Why Grow It:** Adds beauty to your garden while still being safe for curious cats.

| **Chrysanthemum** | Contains pyrethrins, natural pesticides that are poisonous. | Vomiting, diarrhoea, hyper‑salivation, disorientation. |
