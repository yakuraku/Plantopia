## What Is Parsley?

- **Botanical name:** *Petroselinum crispum*  
- **Key nutrients:** Vitamin C, potassium, iron, magnesium, calcium  
- **Two main varieties**  
  - **Italian (flat‑leaf)** – richer flavor, great for cooking  
  - **Curly‑leaf** – ornamental, popular for garnishes  

> *Parsley is a biennial, but most gardeners treat it as an annual.*  
> Successive sowing keeps a steady supply flowing.

**Origins & History**  
- Native to the Mediterranean, now a staple worldwide.

## Parsley Seeds: Fresh Is Best

| Tip | Why It Matters |

| **Use within a year of purchase** | Keeps germination rates high. |
| **Succession sowing** | Plant several batches to maintain a continuous harvest. |

## Parsley Germination: To Soak or Not to Soak?

**The Challenge**  
Parsley seeds can be slow to sprout, earning a quirky folklore reputation. The real culprit? *Furamocoumarins*—chemicals that protect the seed but can also inhibit its own germination.

**The Simple Fix**  
- **Soak overnight in lukewarm water**  
  - Dilutes the chemicals  
  - Softens the seed coat  
  - Leads to faster, more even germination  

> *Optional but highly effective—many gardeners swear by it.*

## Parsley Growing Tips

### Planting

- **Direct sow** or grow seedlings and transplant.  
- **Handle with care** – parsley’s taproot dislikes disturbance.  
- **Harvest leaves** after ~3 months.  
  - Pinch off outer leaves, leave inner ones to keep growth going.

### Pests to Watch

| Pest | What It Does | Quick Fix |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Carrot fly** | Lays eggs on leaves; larvae feed on roots | Hose spray or mild soap solution |
| **White fly** | Sap‑sucking, breeds rapidly | Hose spray or mild soap solution |

### Avoiding Bolting

- **Consistent moisture** is key.  
- **Afternoon shade** helps in hot weather.  
- **Second‑year flowering**: leaves become bitter—time to sow new seed.  
  - *Leave a few to flower; bees love the umbel heads!*

## Parsley in the Kitchen

- **Fresh or dried** – both work great.  
- **Common blends**  
  - Mixed herbs  
  - Bouquet garni (with bay leaves, thyme, marjoram)

### Recipe Ideas

- Salads, pestos, soups  
- Tabbouleh, chimichurri  
- Eggs, fish, and more

### Eat the Whole Plant

- **Leaves, stalks, roots, seeds** – all edible.  
- **Roots**: stronger flavor, harvest in the second year when leaves toughen.
