# Attract Beneficial Insects to Your Garden with a Bee Hotel

A thriving insect community is the backbone of a healthy garden.  
Without pollinators—bees, moths, beetles—your fruit and veggie yields suffer, while natural predators like wasps keep pest populations in check. A garden buzzing with insects also supports birds and other wildlife, boosting overall biodiversity.

Insects will find their way into almost any garden, but pesticides and habitat loss threaten many species. Giving them a safe, comfortable home is a simple yet powerful way to help. That’s where a **bee hotel** comes in.

## What Is a Bee Hotel?

Solitary bees and wasps naturally nest in hollow stems, tree holes, or rock tunnels. A bee hotel recreates these conditions, offering a ready-made nesting site right in your garden.  

- **Commercial options**: Many stylish designs are available, turning the hotel into a garden feature.  
- **DIY**: Building your own is inexpensive, fun, and highly customizable.  

Whatever you choose, the goal is to provide a shelter that meets the insects’ nesting needs.

## Bee Hotel Basic Design

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Frame** (square or rectangular) | Holds everything together |
| **Open front** | Easy access for insects |
| **Closed back** | Adds rigidity & keeps wind out |
| **Solid roof** | Overhangs the front by at least **5 cm** to keep rain out, keeping the interior dry and mold‑free |

### Size Guidelines

- **Typical dimensions**: ~30 cm wide × 30 cm high × 20 cm deep.  
- **Why smaller?** A compact hotel reduces crowding, lowering disease, parasite, and predator risks.  
- **Need more space?** Build multiple hotels and spread them around the garden.

## Choosing the Hotel Materials

- **Natural, untreated wood** is best for nesting areas.  
  - Repurposed or salvaged wood works—just sand off any paint or stain.  
  - Paint only the outer surfaces if you want a splash of color.  
- **Roof**: Use sturdy hardwood, a reused terracotta tile, or similar waterproof material.  
- **Avoid** glass or plastic—these can trap heat and condensation, harming the insects.

## Creating the Hotel Rooms

Inside the frame, arrange a variety of tunnel‑like cells. Place materials lengthwise with ends pointing outward. Common choices:

- **Small logs or sticks** – dry, rot‑free wood creates crevices.  
- **Thicker logs or blocks** – drill holes for larger insects.  
- **Cardboard straws or tubes** – 2–10 mm diameter.  
- **Bamboo canes** – internal diameter < 10 mm.  
- **Bundled dried, hollow stems** (reeds, berry canes, etc.) – smooth open ends to avoid injury.

### Drilling Holes in Wood

When creating cells by drilling:

- **Diameter**: Vary between **2 mm and 10 mm** to accommodate different species.  
- **Length**: At least **15 cm** long; holes should not pass completely through the wood.  
- **Smoothness**: Countersink the entrance and sand the interior to remove splinters.  
- **Depth variation**: Adds diversity; drilling to the drill bit depth is acceptable.

## Where to Place Your Insect Hotel

- **Height**: Mount at least **1 m** off the ground to deter lizards and frogs.  
- **Stability**: Secure firmly to withstand wind.  
- **Sunlight**: Position facing **north or northeast** for optimal warmth.  
- **Clearance**: Keep away from fast‑growing vegetation that could block entrances.

## Regular Hotel Maintenance

1. **End of summer**  
   - Inspect cells for occupancy.  
   - Leave overwintering insects undisturbed.  
   - Remove debris from abandoned cells.

2. **Spring**  
   - Clear moss or buildup.  
   - Prune surrounding plants to keep the front clear.

3. **Pre‑arrival**  
   - Check straws, reeds, and sticks for deterioration.  
   - Replace any that are rotting or damaged.

By protecting insects from pesticides and providing a safe nesting spot, a bee hotel not only supports pollination and pest control but also enriches your garden’s ecosystem. Enjoy the buzz of life and the bounty it brings!
