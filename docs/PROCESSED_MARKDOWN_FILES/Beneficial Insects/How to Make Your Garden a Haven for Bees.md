# How to Make Your Garden a Haven for Bees

Bees are **essential** to the global ecosystem—without their pollination, roughly **35 % of the world’s food harvest** would be at risk, and many familiar crops could disappear.  
Yet industrial agriculture, disease, and climate change threaten them, with honeybees losing up to a third of their populations worldwide.  
In Australia the worst impacts haven’t hit yet, but complacency isn’t an option. Both introduced honeybees and the hundreds of native species need a little extra help to stay healthy and abundant.

## The Problem with Modern Gardens

Modern gardens can look stunning yet be *bee‑unfriendly*:

- **Flowers bred for beauty** (especially double‑headed blooms) often contain little or no nectar that bees can reach.
- **Limited variety**: A few species that bloom in a short window give bees only a brief nectar supply.
- **Obsessed tidiness**: Pathways and weed‑free beds leave little for bees to forage or nest in.

From a bee’s perspective, an ideal garden would be almost wild, with a year‑long supply of flowers and plenty of untidy nooks for nesting.  
But most gardeners want order. The good news? You can strike a balance by planting a mix of bee‑attracting species and creating simple habitat pockets.

## Bees’ Favourite Bloom Types

Bees aren’t picky—**any good nectar source** will do, especially if it’s available *throughout the year*.  
They tend to favor:

- **White, blue, and purple** hues
- **Highly perfumed** flowers

However, a *wide range* of flowering plants is far more important than focusing on colour alone.  
Remember: a beautiful bloom to us isn’t always a tasty treat for bees. Decorative varieties can be low in nectar or have nectaries hidden deep inside the flower.

## The Best Flowers for Attracting Bees

Nearly any single‑headed bloom will attract bees, but the following are especially effective:

| Plant | Why It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| **Salvia** | Dense spikes of nectar‑rich flowers |
| **Candytuft** | Early spring bloom, long flowering period |
| **Sunflower** | Large, accessible nectar and pollen |
| **Alyssum** | Small, fragrant flowers that attract many bees |
| **Cosmos** | Bright, long‑lasting blooms |
| **Nasturtiums** | Easy to grow, abundant nectar |
| **Cornflower** | Classic bee favourite, long bloom time |

### Bee‑Friendly Herbs

Herbs aren’t just tasty—they’re also nectar powerhouses. Try these:

- **Lemon Balm**
- **Lavender**
- **Rosemary**
- **Catnip**
- **Coriander**
- **Basil**

Other bee‑loving herbs include:

- Queen Anne’s Lace
- Borage
- Chives
- Thyme
- Mint family members

## Bees in the Vegetable Patch

Vegetables can support bees in two ways:

1. **Flowering crops**: Many vegetables produce flowers during fruiting.
2. **Seed‑bearing crops**: Leaving certain plants to go to seed (e.g., carrots) creates late‑season flowers.

### Key Pollinated Veggies

| Crop | Bee Benefit |
|------|-------------|
| **Zucchini, pumpkins, cucumber** | Male & female flowers provide nectar; bees transfer pollen |
| **Tomatoes & chillies** | Even self‑pollinating varieties benefit from bee “buzzing” to release pollen |
| **Peas** | Self‑pollinating but attract bees with white/pink flowers in spring |
| **Runner beans** | Continuous flowers if you keep picking fruit |

### Salad Greens

Grow **rocket, lettuce, and other greens** and let some bolt to seed. The resulting flowers add another nectar source.

## Other Ways to Help Bees

Beyond flowers, create simple habitats:

- **Rotting wood**: Leave a few logs in a quiet corner; drill holes to encourage nesting.
- **Bare soil**: Avoid mulching every inch; some species burrow into exposed ground.
- **Rocky crevices**: Leave a few cracks for ground‑nesting bees.

**Avoid insecticides**—they linger in flowers and nectar for weeks or months, harming bees and pollinators worldwide.

By combining a diverse array of flowering plants, bee‑friendly herbs, and thoughtful habitat pockets, you can turn your garden into a thriving haven for bees—helping both your garden and the planet’s vital pollinators.
