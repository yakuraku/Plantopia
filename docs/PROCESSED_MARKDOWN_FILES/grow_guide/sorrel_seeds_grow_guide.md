# How to Grow Sorrel Seeds

**Family:** Polygonaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Rumex sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

Sorrel can be a *persistent* weed once it takes root.  
- **Choose a permanent spot** in a garden bed or grow in containers to keep it from spreading.  
- **Sunlight:** Full sun to part shade; aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:** Needs well‑drained, organically rich earth.  
  - Thoroughly weed and loosen the soil.  
  - Add **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Containers:**  
  - Pick a variety suited for container growth.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Containers should be **≥ 20 L** to accommodate mature plants.  
  - Remember that container plants often need **extra fertiliser** during the growing season.

## How to Sow Sorrel Seeds

Sorrel seeds are *easy* to start—no soaking or stratification required.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep** and **30 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but never wet or dry**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–14 days** at **22 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist but not soggy** soil. |
| 4 | Germinate in **7–14 days** at **22 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **30 cm apart** in the garden. |

> **Tip:** Sorrel is a cool‑season crop; avoid sowing or transplanting in very hot weather to prevent premature bolting.

## How to Grow Sorrel

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil is dry **≈ 5 cm below the surface** (check by scratching a bit of soil).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  

- **Fertilising:**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, **no extra fertiliser** is needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑nitrogen** or leafy‑green‑specific fertiliser:  
    - **Slow‑release**: apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid**: apply at the recommended rate and frequency during the season.  

- **Thinning:**  
  - When seedlings are large enough, thin them to **30 cm spacing** by pulling out weaker ones.  

- **Flower Removal:**  
  - To extend the plant’s life, **remove flower stalks** as soon as they appear.  

- **Winter Survival:**  
  - In cold climates, sorrel may die back in winter and **reshoot from rhizomes** in spring.  
  - **Rejuvenate** every **2–3 years** by lifting and dividing the rhizomes in spring.

## How to Harvest Sorrel

- **Timing:** Leaves are ready in about **60 days**.  
- **Method:** Cut the outer leaves at the base, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
- **Freshness:** Best eaten immediately after harvest.  
- **Short‑term storage:** Keep in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
- **Long‑term storage:** Freeze leaves in ice‑cube trays.

## Common Problems When Growing Sorrel

| Problem | What Happens | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small sap‑suckers (2–4 mm) on new shoots or leaf undersides; cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Bitter Taste** | Often due to slow growth, setbacks, or late harvest. | Enrich soil with aged manure, water deeply and regularly, and harvest when leaves are young and tender. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set, usually triggered by extreme weather. | Avoid sowing until after frost danger; in hot weather, water deeply to prevent heat stress. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that nibble tender leaves at night, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use torchlight to spot them, or set up traps. *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
