## Preparation

### Pick the Right Spot  
- **Perennial varieties only** – they’ll live for several years.  
- Choose a **permanent location** that won’t be disturbed by digging or heavy foot traffic.  

### Sun & Soil  
- **Sunlight:** Full sun or part shade; aim for **≥3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:** Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly.  
  - Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  - Add **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  

### Container Growing  
- If you’re using pots, pick a variety **recommended for container use**.  
- Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
- **Container size:** Minimum **10 L** for mature plants.  
- Container plants often need **extra fertiliser** during the growing season.

## How to Sow Phlox Seeds

Phlox seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking or stratification required.

### 1. Direct Sowing  
| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Depth** | 3 mm |
| **Spacing** | 15–25 cm apart |
| **Moisture** | Keep soil **moist but never wet or dry** |
| **Germination** | 14–21 days at 18–20 °C |
| **Protection** | Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First  
| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Containers** | Trays, punnets, or jiffy pots |
| **Seed‑raising mix** | Good quality or soil starter pellets |
| **Depth** | 3 mm |
| **Moisture** | Same as direct sowing |
| **Germination** | 14–21 days at 18–20 °C |
| **Transplanting** | When seedlings have their first true leaves and are 5–10 cm tall |
| **Spacing** | 15–25 cm apart |

> **Tip:** Phlox is a *half‑hardy* crop. Mature plants tolerate light frosts, but seedlings need protection. **Do not sow or transplant until after the last frost**.  
> In cooler climates, start indoors **6 weeks before the last expected frost** in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Phlox

### Watering  
- Keep soil **evenly moist** but never waterlogged.  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising  
- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertiliser.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost:  
  - **High‑potassium or flowering‑plant fertiliser**  
  - *Slow‑release:* apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
  - *Liquid:* apply during fruiting or flowering at the recommended rate/frequency.

### Flowering  
- Expect blooms in **70–90 days**.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading or dead flowers just above a set of leaves with sharp secateurs or snips.  
- For **cut flowers**: cut the longest stems, remove lower leaves, and place immediately in clean water.

### Perennial Care  
- After flowering, **prune back** to tidy the plant and encourage new growth.  
- Cut stems just above a lower leaf set with sharp tools.

## Common Problems When Growing Phlox

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Handle |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Grey mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Mouldy flowers, rotting fruit | Prune affected parts, water at soil level, use fungicide or homemade spray |
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially undersides | Water at soil level, remove/destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding, consider milk spray or fungicide |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots spreading across leaves | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide or homemade spray |
| **Slugs & snails** | Slimy trails, tender leaf damage at night | Remove hiding spots, free‑range poultry, torchlight collection, traps |
