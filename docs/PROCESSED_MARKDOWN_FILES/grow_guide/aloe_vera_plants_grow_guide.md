# How to Grow Aloe Vera Plants

**Family:** Asphodelaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Aloe barbadensis_  
**Life Cycle:** perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Aloe vera thrives in *full sun* or *partial shade*. Aim for at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Indoor care:** Place containers in bright, filtered light.  
- **Permanent spot:** Since aloe vera is perennial, choose a location where the plant can stay undisturbed for years.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, loosen the soil, and add aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Containers:**  
  - Pick a variety suited for container growing.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot that holds at least **10 L**.  
  - During the growing season, container plants may benefit from extra fertiliser to promote healthy growth.  

## How to Plant Aloe Plants

Aloe vera comes as bare‑rooted plants. Plant **as soon as possible** after delivery.

### Planting in a Container

1. Fill a pot with a good quality cactus or succulent potting mix.  
2. Position the plant so the base of the leaves sits at ground level.  
3. Support cuttings with small stakes or bamboo canes until they are firmly rooted.  
4. Water immediately after planting, then **no more than once a week**.  

### Planting in the Garden

1. Dig a hole **at least four times the width** of the root ball to give roots room to spread.  
2. Place the aloe so the leaf base is level with or slightly above the soil line.  
3. Support cuttings with stakes or bamboo canes until rooted.  
4. Water after planting, then **no more than once a week**, checking soil moisture first.  

> Aloe plants tolerate occasional light frosts but are not hardy in climates with regular frosts.  

## How to Grow Aloe Vera

- **Watering:**  
  - Aloe vera is drought‑tolerant once established.  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings; water only when the soil is dry **10 cm** below the surface (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
  - Water deeply in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  

- **Fertilising:**  
  - If soil is well prepared, no extra fertiliser is needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - *Apply a slow‑release fertiliser* at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings are **5–10 cm** tall.  
    - *Apply a liquid fertiliser* at the recommended rate and frequency while plants are fruiting or flowering.  

- **Deadheading:**  
  - Remove fading or dead flowers regularly to encourage new blooms.  
  - Use sharp secateurs or snips to cut flowers just above a set of leaves.  
  - *Learn more about deadheading flowering plants here.*  

## How to Harvest Aloe Vera

- **Harvest time:** Roughly **350 days** after planting.  
- **Safety:** The yellow sap (aloin) can irritate skin. Wear gloves when harvesting.  
- **Procedure:**  
  1. Ensure the plant is firmly rooted and has several large, thick leaves.  
  2. Cut outer leaves at soil level with a clean, sharp knife.  
  3. Leave at least **five central leaves** to support future growth.  
  4. Alternatively, harvest only the top part of a leaf, leaving the rest on the plant.  
- **Processing:**  
  1. Place cut leaves cut‑side down in a glass or jar; let the yellow sap drain for **15–30 min**.  
  2. Rinse the leaves.  
  3. Peel to expose the gel or squeeze the gel out of smaller leaves.  
  4. Use immediately, or wrap leaves in damp paper towels, seal in a plastic bag, and refrigerate for up to a week.  
  5. For longer storage, freeze whole leaves in freezer bags or make gel into ice cubes.  

## Common Problems When Growing Aloe Vera

| Problem | Description | Management |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides. They can wilt leaves and excrete honeydew that attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray<br>• Encourage predatory insects | *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Mealybugs** (_Pseudococcidae_ sp.) | 3–6 mm white, pink, or gray insects covered in a cotton‑like coating. They cause wilting and honeydew. | • Wipe leaves<br>• Soap or alcohol spray<br>• Encourage predators | *Read more about mealybugs here.* |
| **Scale** | Diverse sap‑sucking insects on shoots or leaf undersides; can be hard or soft bodied and various colors. They damage leaves and produce honeydew. | • Brush or hose off leaves<br>• Soap spray<br>• Prune heavily infested parts | *Read more about scale here.* |
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Brown spots that start wet and become dry, scab‑like. Leaves and flowers may drop prematurely. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves<br>• Dispose of fallen leaves and fruit<br>• Practice crop rotation |  |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia_ sp.) | Brown to orange raised spots or patches on foliage. Spreads by wind or water, especially at 10–20 °C and high humidity. | • Space plants to avoid overcrowding<br>• Provide full sun<br>• Avoid over‑fertilising<br>• Remove dead plants<br>• Crop rotation | *Read more about rust fungus here.* |
| **Gall mites** (Eriophyid mites) | Microscopic pests that cause distorted, abnormal growth—bumpy or blistered foliage, excess shoots, thick leaves, abnormal buds or flowers. | • Correct identification is key<br>• Dispose of plants with damaging gall |  |
| **Root rot** | Soil‑borne fungal disease in wet soil. Symptoms: slow establishment, yellowing or wilted foliage, soft brown tissue at stem base and roots. | • Remove and dispose of affected plants<br>• Reduce soil moisture<br>• Add organic matter<br>• Keep mulch away from stems |  |
