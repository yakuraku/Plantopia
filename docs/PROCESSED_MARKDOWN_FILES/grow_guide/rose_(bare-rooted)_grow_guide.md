# How to Grow Rose (bare‑rooted)

**Family:** Rosaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Rosa sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

Roses are surprisingly easy to grow, but choosing the right variety for your climate and giving it the right care will set you up for success.

- **Temperate & cool‑to‑cold climates:** Most roses thrive here.  
- **Subtropical & tropical climates:** Humidity can invite fungal diseases. Pick disease‑resistant varieties and *ensure good air flow* around the plants.  
- **Arid climates:** Look for roses with thicker leaves and petals. Provide *extra water* and *shade* from the hot summer sun when needed.

**Sunlight:** Aim for at least **6 hours of direct sun per day**. Less light = weaker plants and fewer blooms.

**Soil:**  
- Loose, well‑drained, enriched with organic matter.  
- Weeding, digging to a spade’s depth, and adding aged animal manure or compost lightens heavy soils and frees roots.  
- Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **pH:** 6.5 – 7.0. Adjust slowly with lime (to raise) or iron chelates/powdered sulphur (to lower). Follow product instructions.

> **Tip:** Avoid replanting into soil that has previously held roses—residual disease can kill your new plant. Either replace the soil entirely or let it rest for an extended period.

## How to Plant Bare‑rooted Roses

Plant as soon as you receive them; roots must stay moist.

1. **Soak** the roots in plain water for **24‑48 h** before planting.  
2. Pick a spot with **≥ 6 h of sun**.  
3. Dig a **30 cm deep** hole and create a mound at the bottom.  
4. Spread the roots over the mound.  
5. Make sure the *soil mark on the stem* sits level with the soil surface.  
6. Partially backfill, gently firm, then **water** the hole.  
7. Trim the stem to **≈ 20 cm above the graft** and **1 cm above a bud**.  
8. Water *regularly* for the first year until the plant is established.  
9. **Do not fertilise** until the rose starts to flower.

## How to Grow Roses

### Watering  
- Once established, roses are drought tolerant.  
- **Cool months:** deep soak **once a week**.  
- **Warm months:** deep soak **twice a week**.  
- *Deep soaking* encourages deep roots; frequent light watering encourages shallow, weak roots.

### Fertilising  
- Roses are heavy feeders.  
- Fertilise **three times a year**:  
  1. First flush in spring  
  2. Start of summer  
  3. Start of autumn  
- Skip winter and the planting period.  
- Use organic, pelletised, or liquid fertiliser—follow the label.

### Deadheading  
- Remove fading or dead flowers *just above a set of leaves* with sharp secateurs or snips.  
- Regular deadheading encourages more blooms.

### Cutting for Cut Flowers  
- Use sharp snips or secateurs to cut the longest stems possible.  
- Remove lower leaves, place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.

## How to Prune Roses

Pruning keeps roses tidy, strong, and productive. Do it **mid‑to‑late winter or early spring**.

1. Cut **2/3 of the plant height**.  
2. Remove dead or diseased wood—cut neatly at the base of the stem.  
3. Clear remaining foliage.  
4. Eliminate spindly, untidy shoots.  
5. Remove crossing branches to reduce crowding.  
6. Drop old, under‑performing branches.  
7. Cut suckers below the graft union.

After pruning, spray with **Lime Sulphur** to kill fungal spores and pest eggs—especially useful in humid gardens prone to black spot and mildew. *Use only after pruning when the plant is dormant*; it can defoliate.

### Exceptions to General Pruning Rules

| Variety | Pruning Needs | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| **Heritage, Old‑Fashioned, Species** | Little to no pruning; remove only dead wood | Light trimming keeps the plant neat |
| **Climbing Roses** | Do **not** prune main canes (support structure). Trim lateral canes to **6‑8 cm**, leaving at least three growth buds. | Tie to support, train over pergolas or trellises |
| **Ground‑Cover Roses** | Minimal pruning; remove dead heads and give a light trim now and then | Keeps plants tidy |
| **Standard Roses** | Prune like bush roses; support with a stake to prevent top‑heavy tipping | Secure ties, but not restrictive |

## Common Problems When Growing Roses

| Pest / Disease | Symptoms | Management |
|----------------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2‑4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, encourage predatory insects |
| **Grey Mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Mouldy flowers, rotting fruit; spores spread by wind | Prune affected parts, water at soil level, use fungicide or homemade spray |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches on leaf undersides | Water at soil level, remove/destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding, use homemade milk spray or fungicide |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia_ sp.) | Brown‑to‑orange raised spots on foliage | Space plants, provide full sun, avoid over‑fertilising, remove dead plants, practice crop rotation |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves | Water at soil level, improve air flow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide or homemade spray |
| **Scale** | Sap‑sucking insects on shoots or leaf undersides; honeydew | Brush or hose off, apply soap spray, prune heavily infested parts |
| **Thrips** | Small flying insects; larvae leave tiny white or transparent marks on leaves and petals | Wash with a garden hose, encourage predatory mites/lacewings, use soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil |
