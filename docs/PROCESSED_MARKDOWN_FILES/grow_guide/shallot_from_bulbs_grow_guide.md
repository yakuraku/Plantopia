# How to Grow Shallots from Bulbs  

**Family:** Amaryllidaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Allium cepa var. aggregatum_  
**Life Cycle:** perennial (usually grown as an annual)  

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Choose a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Loose, well‑drained loam enriched with organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, then dig to a **spade’s depth** to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost** to lighten heavy soils and boost fertility.  
- **Weed control:** Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  

> *Tip:* A well‑prepared bed means fewer problems later on.  

## How to Plant Shallot Bulbs  

Shallot bulbs are best planted **directly in the garden**.  

1. **Spacing:** Plant each bulb **20 cm apart**.  
2. **Orientation:** Point the tip upward and leave it just **visible above the soil surface**.  
3. **Cover & Water:**  
   - Cover with soil.  
   - Water well, then keep the soil **moist but not waterlogged** until shoots appear.  

## How to Grow Shallots  

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface; water when it feels dry.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is well‑prepared, skip extra fertilizer.  
  - Over‑fertilizing can cause lush leaves at the expense of roots.  
  - In poor soil, use a **low‑nitrogen, high‑phosphorus** fertilizer (e.g., blood and bone) at the recommended rate.  

## How to Harvest Shallots  

- **Timing:** Harvest after **≈120 days**.  
- **Signs of readiness:**  
  - The neck between bulb and leaves softens.  
  - Leaves begin to fall over.  
- **Procedure:**  
  1. Use a fork to gently lift the plant, shaking off excess soil.  
  2. Test one plant first; if the bulb is small or missing, wait 2–3 weeks before harvesting the rest.  
  3. **Curing:** Place whole plants on wire racks or hang in bunches in a dry, cool spot for **2–3 weeks**.  
  4. For bulbs with thick necks, eat them soon after harvest.  
  5. For other bulbs, cut dried leaves **3–4 cm above** the bulb.  
- **Storage:** Keep cured bulbs in a cool, dry place for up to **6 months**.  

## Common Problems When Growing Shallots  

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Why It Happens | How to Fix It |
|---------|--------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants | Sap‑sucking, stress from heat or drought | Spray with water, use soap/alcohol spray, encourage predators |
| **Bulbs Not Forming** | Early harvest, inconsistent watering, small bulbs, excess nitrogen | Poor conditions or wrong variety | Use climate‑suitable varieties, avoid over‑fertilizing, water consistently, harvest after leaf senescence |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set | Extreme weather (cold or heat) | Wait until frost danger passes, avoid hot weather, water deeply during heat |
| **Rust (Puccinia sp.)** | Brown/orange raised spots on foliage | 10–20 °C, high humidity, wind or water spread | Space plants, provide full sun, avoid over‑fertilizing, remove dead material, rotate crops |
| **Onion Thrips (Thrips tabaci)** | Silver patches on leaves, reduced yield | Sap‑sucking, often in leaf folds | Hose wash, mulch, attract predatory mites/lacewings, companion plant |
| **Rotten Bulbs/Corms** | Rot, no roots/shoots, stunted yellow leaves | Cold, wet soil, waterlogging, warm winter temps | Plant in well‑drained beds or containers, avoid watering during dormancy, lift and store if needed |

> *Remember:* Prevention is key—good soil, proper spacing, and consistent care keep problems at bay.
