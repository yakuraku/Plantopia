## How to Sow Catmint Seeds

Catmint seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification required.

1. **Start indoors** (optional in cool climates): sow 6 weeks before the last expected frost in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.  
2. **Seed trays:**  
   - Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** or soil starter pellets.  
   - **Sow** seeds **10 mm deep**.  
   - Keep the soil **moist** but never *wet* or *dry*.  
3. **Germination:**  
   - Seeds sprout in **10–20 days** at a soil temperature of **21–27 °C**.

- **Fertilizer:** Catmint tolerates *nutrient‑poor* soils and usually needs no extra fertilizer during the growing season.  
- **Flowering:**  
  - Expect blooms in **~90 days**.  
  - **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading or dead flowers just above a leaf set with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - This encourages more flowers.

## Common Problems When Growing Catmint

| Pest / Issue | What It Looks Like | How to Manage |
|--------------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray<br>• Invite predatory insects |
| **Root rot** | Slow establishment, yellowing or wilted foliage, soft brown tissue at stem base and roots. | • Remove and discard affected plants<br>• Reduce soil moisture<br>• Add organic matter<br>• Keep mulch away from stems |
| **Spider mites** (Tetranychus urticae) | Dry, wilted or discolored leaves; undersides feel sandpaper‑like. | • Prune for better airflow<br>• Spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulfur |
| **Thrips** | Tiny black/beige/white insects (<1.5 mm); larvae leave small white or transparent marks on leaves and petals. | • Wash with a garden hose<br>• Encourage predatory mites and lacewings via companion planting<br>• Spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insects similar to aphids; swarm in clouds on leaf undersides; cause yellowing, wilting, and stunted growth. | • Spray with a garden hose or soap spray<br>• Destroy severely affected plants<br>• Attract beneficial insects |
