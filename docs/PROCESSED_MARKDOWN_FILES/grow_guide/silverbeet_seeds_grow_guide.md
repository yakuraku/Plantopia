# How to Grow Silverbeet Seeds

**Family:** Amaranthaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Beta vulgaris_  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Silverbeet loves *full sun* – pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Aim for a **loose, well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, then dig it over to at least a spade’s depth.  
  - Work in **aged animal manure or compost** to lighten heavy soils and give roots room to breathe.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Containers:**  
  - Silverbeet can thrive in pots—just pick a variety suited for container growing.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot that’s **at least 40 L** in volume.  
  - Remember: container plants often need a bit more fertilizer to stay healthy.  

## How to Sow Silverbeet Seeds

> **Optional:** Silverbeet seeds don’t need pre‑treatment, but soaking them overnight in *room‑temperature water* can give you a more uniform germination.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **15 mm deep** and **20–35 cm apart**; space rows **50–60 cm** apart. |
| 2 | Keep the soil **moist but never water‑logged**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **5–10 days** at a soil temperature of **10–30 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **good seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **15 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist but not soggy** soil. |
| 4 | Germination: **5–10 days** at **10–30 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **20–35 cm apart**; rows **50–60 cm** apart. |

## How to Grow Silverbeet

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil moisture by scratching a bit of soil with your finger; water when it’s **dry about 5 cm below the surface**.  
  - Water **deeply** in the **early morning or late afternoon** to reduce evaporation.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to keep fungal diseases at bay.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil was well‑prepared, you may not need extra fertilizer.  
  - In poorer soils or for a boost, use a **high‑nitrogen fertilizer** or one made for leafy greens/herbs.  
    - **Slow‑release:** apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid:** apply at the recommended rate and frequency during the growing season.  
- **Pruning:**  
  - **Tip:** To keep the plant productive, **remove flower stalks** as soon as they appear.  

## How to Harvest Silverbeet

- **Timing:** Harvest 50–90 days after sowing.  
- **Method:**  
  - Pick outer leaves at the base, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
  - Consume fresh leaves promptly.  
  - **Short‑term storage:** keep in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - **Long‑term storage:** blanch the leaves, then freeze.  

## Common Problems When Growing Silverbeet

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Fix It |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set, often after a heat or cold shock. | Sow after frost danger; keep plants well‑watered in hot weather to reduce heat stress. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Tender leaves and shoots eaten at night, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, spot‑check by torchlight, or use traps. *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scabs; leaves and flowers may drop early. | Water at soil level only, discard fallen leaves/fruit, practice crop rotation. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level, remove and destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding for good airflow. If persistent, spray with homemade milk spray or a fungicide. |
| **Boron Deficiency** | Yellow leaf tips, hollow or discoloured stems, soft brown roots. | Dissolve **1 tablespoon of household boron** in **5 L of water**; apply when seedlings are **5–10 cm** tall. **Do not use as a general fertilizer**—boron can be toxic to some plants. |
