## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Basil loves *full sun*. Pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, loosen the soil, and mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing basil in pots, choose a variety that’s **container‑friendly**.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot that holds **≥10 L** (about 2.5 gal).  
  - Remember: container plants often need a bit more fertilizer to stay healthy.

## How to Sow Basil Seeds

Basil seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking or stratification required.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **3 mm** deep, spacing **25–40 cm** apart. |
| 2 | Keep the soil **moist**—never soggy or dry. |
| 3 | Germination takes **5–10 days** at **18–35 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **3 mm** deep. |
| 3 | Maintain moist soil—avoid both wet and dry extremes. |
| 4 | Germination: **5–10 days** at **18–35 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm** tall. |
| 6 | Space plants **25–40 cm** apart when planting out. |

**Tip:** For a quick start, try the *scatter seed* method—roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil.

## How to Grow Basil

- **Watering:**  
  - Check the soil 5 cm below the surface; water when it feels dry.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- **Thinning:**  
  - Once seedlings are large enough to handle, thin out weak ones so plants are **25–40 cm** apart.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, you may skip extra fertilizer.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - *Slow‑release* fertilizer at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - *Liquid* fertilizer at the recommended rate and frequency during the growing season.  
  - A high‑nitrogen or herb‑specific formula works well.

## How to Harvest Basil

- **Timing:** Basil is ready to harvest in **60–80 days**.  
- **Method:** Pinch off outer leaves, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
- **Use & Storage:**  
  - Use fresh leaves immediately for the best flavor.  
  - Short‑term: store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - Long‑term: freeze whole leaves or chop and freeze in ice‑cube trays.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | What Happens | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insects swarm on leaf undersides, causing yellowing, wilting, and stunted growth. | Rinse with a garden hose or spray with a mild soap solution. Encourage beneficial insects. If severe, remove the plant. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | They munch on tender shoots at night, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, use free‑range poultry, spot‑collect at night, or set up traps. |
| **Damping Off** | Fungal infection makes seedlings rot at the base, often before they even emerge. | Use fresh potting mix, avoid overwatering, keep foliage dry, and ensure good airflow. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed production, often triggered by heat or stress. | Plant after frost danger has passed, keep soil consistently moist, and provide deep watering during hot spells. |
| **Frost Damage** | Leaves wilt and turn black. | Delay planting until all frost risk is gone; harvest before winter; prune damaged leaves to prevent rot. |

**Remember:** Basil thrives with plenty of light, well‑drained soil, and consistent moisture. Keep an eye on pests, give your plants a gentle boost with fertilizer if needed, and enjoy fresh leaves in no time!
