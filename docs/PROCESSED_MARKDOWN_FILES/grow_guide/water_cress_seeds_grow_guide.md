# How to Grow Water Cress Seeds

**Family:** Brassicaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Nasturtium officinale_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot** – Water cress is a perennial, so pick a location that won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Sunlight:** Full sun or part shade; aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Water quality:**  
  - If growing in a pond or stream, keep the water **free of livestock or animal waste**.  
  - Downstream of animal waste can introduce **liver fluke**—a parasite that can infect people and cause long‑term liver disease.  
- **Soil method:**  
  - Keep the soil **consistently moist** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen, and amend with **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area seed‑free until planting.

## Growing Water Cress in Water

Water cress seeds need **no pre‑treatment** (no soaking or stratification).

1. **Set up a shallow container** (saucer or tray) with water.  
2. **Sprinkle seeds** over the surface.  
3. Place in **part sun**.  
4. **Refresh the water** as needed—clear, fresh water is essential.  
5. **Germination:** 12‑15 days.  
6. When seedlings have **4‑6 true leaves** and are easy to handle, **transplant** them into a pond or stream.

> **Tip:** Water cress may die back in cold weather. Cut back in late autumn or prune dead foliage when new growth appears in spring.

## Growing Water Cress in the Garden

Seeds still require **no pre‑treatment**.

1. Fill trays or punnets with a **high‑quality seed‑raising mix**.  
2. Sow seeds **3 mm deep**.  
3. Submerge the container **half‑deep in water**.  
4. Place in **part sun**.  
5. **Germination:** 12‑15 days at a soil temperature of 8‑15 °C.  
6. Transplant seedlings once they have their **first true leaves** and are large enough to handle.  
7. **Spacing:** 100 cm between plants.

### Container Growing

- Use a **good quality potting mix**.  
- Minimum **20 L pot** for mature plants.  
- Place the pot on a deep saucer so the bottom sits in water.  
- Replace saucer water if it becomes muddy.  
- **Keep soil moist** throughout the growing season.

## Fertilization

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
- In poor soil or for a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release fertilizer** at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings are 5‑10 cm tall.  
  - **Liquid fertilizer** at the recommended rate/frequency while plants are fruiting or flowering.

## Harvesting

- **Ready to harvest:** 50‑60 days after sowing.  
- Harvest by **pinching off outer stems and leaves**, leaving some on the plant for regrowth.  
- **Short‑term storage:** Place in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
- **Hydration method:** Put stems in a glass or jar of water.  
- **Long‑term storage:** Freeze and later use in pestos, soups, or salads.

## Common Problems & How to Handle Them

| Pest/Disease | Symptoms | Management |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** (2‑4 mm) | New shoots or leaf undersides wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants | - Spray with a garden hose<br>- Use soap or alcohol spray<br>- Encourage predatory insects |
| **Spider Mites** (Tetranychus urticae) | Dry, wilted, or discolored leaves; undersides feel sandpaper‑like | - Prune for better airflow<br>- Spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulfur |
| **Whitefly** | Yellowing or wilting leaves; growth slows; swarms on disturbance | - Hose spray or soap spray<br>- Destroy severely affected plants<br>- Attract beneficial insects |
