**Family:** Lamiaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Plectranthus scutellarioides_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

---

## Preparation

Coleus loves **full or part shade**. Pick a spot that gets *no more than 3 hours of direct sun* each day.  

- **Indoor & terrarium use** – Works well in warm climates; plants can live 2–5 years as short‑lived perennials.  
- **Permanent spot** – Choose a location that won’t be disturbed by digging or heavy foot traffic.  

### Soil

- Use a **well‑drained mix** rich in organic matter.  
- Weed thoroughly, loosen the soil, then add aged animal manure or compost.  
- Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  

> *Tip:* For container growing, pick a variety labeled “container‑friendly.”  
> Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot **at least 20 L** in size.  
> Container plants often need extra fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Coleus Seeds

Coleus seeds are **easy to handle**—no soaking or stratification needed.

### 1. Direct Sowing

1. **Plant** seeds 5 mm deep, 50 cm apart.  
2. **Moisture**: Keep soil evenly moist—never waterlogged or dry.  
3. **Germination**: 10–20 days at 18–24 °C.  
4. **Protection**: Shield seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Plant** seeds 5 mm deep.  
3. **Moisture**: Same as above.  
4. **Germination**: 10–20 days at 18–24 °C.  
5. **Transplant** when seedlings have their first true leaves and are 5–10 cm tall.  
6. **Spacing**: 50 cm apart in the garden.

> **Frost warning:** Don’t transplant or sow outdoors until all frost danger has passed.  

### 3. Scatter‑Seed Method (Optional)

- Roughen the soil surface, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil.  
- Ideal for small seeds—helps prevent them from blowing away or washing out.  
- Mix seeds with sand or fine potting mix before sowing, or use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers for precise placement.  
- Press lightly to ensure good seed‑soil contact.

> *Indoor start:* In cooler climates, sow indoors 6 weeks before the last expected frost in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Coleus

### Watering

- **Keep soil moist** but not waterlogged.  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid** wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost:
  - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
  - **Liquid** fertilizer during flowering or fruiting, following the product’s recommended rate and frequency.

### Pruning & Pinching

- Pinch back growing tips to encourage **denser foliage** and stronger stems.  
- Use sharp secateurs or snips; cut just above a set of lower leaves.  
- Remove small flowers to promote leaf growth.

### Maturity

- Coleus typically reaches full maturity in **≈110 days**.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on undersides | Water at soil level, remove affected leaves, improve airflow. If persistent, spray with homemade milk spray or a fungicide. |
| **Mealybugs** (_Pseudococcidae_) | Small (3–6 mm), cotton‑like white, pink, or gray bodies; leaves wilt; honeydew attracts ants | Wipe leaves, spray with soap or alcohol solution, encourage predatory insects. |
| **Scale** | Hard or soft bodies on new shoots or leaf undersides; honeydew | Brush or hose off, spray with soap, prune heavily infested parts. |
| **Whitefly** | Large numbers on leaf undersides; yellowing or wilting leaves; stunted growth | Hose off, spray with soap, attract beneficial insects. Severely affected plants may need to be destroyed. |

> *Tip:* Regular inspection and early intervention keep pests and diseases at bay.
