# How to Grow Beetroot Seeds

**Family:** Amaranthaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Beta vulgaris_  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial (but usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Beetroot loves *full sun*. Pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Loose, well‑drained loam enriched with organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, then dig to a *spade’s depth* (≈30 cm) to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost** to lighten heavy soils and give roots room to grow.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
  - *Tip:* For a deeper dive into soil prep, check out our guide on preparing soil for planting.

## How to Sow Beetroot Seeds

> **Optional:** Beetroot seeds don’t need pre‑treatment, but soaking them overnight in room‑temperature water can give a more uniform germination.

1. **Direct sow**:  
   - Plant seeds **15 mm deep** and **5–10 cm apart**.  
   - Space rows **30–40 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep the soil *moist but never soggy or dry*.  
3. **Germination:** Seeds sprout in **5–10 days** when the soil temperature is **10–30 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

## How to Grow Beetroot

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil feels dry about **5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
  - Aim for **deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering.  
  - Avoid wetting the foliage to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  
- **Thinning (Optional):**  
  - Once seedlings are sturdy, pull out weak or small ones.  
  - Space healthy plants **5–10 cm apart** to give roots room to develop.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is well‑prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is needed.  
  - Over‑fertilizing can cause leafy growth at the expense of roots.  
  - In poor soil, use a low‑nitrogen, high‑phosphorus fertilizer (e.g., *blood and bone*) at the recommended rate.

## How to Harvest Beetroot

- **Timing:** Roots are ready in **55–85 days**.  
- **Leaves:**  
  - Harvest when they’re large enough to eat.  
  - Cut the outer leaves at the base, leaving a few for future growth.  
  - Consume or store promptly.  
  - Store short‑term in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
- **Roots:**  
  - Harvest when they’re the desired size.  
  - Gently pull at the base of the leaves or use a garden fork to lift multiple roots.  
  - Shake off soil, cut the foliage **1–2 cm above** the root.  
  - Store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - For longer storage, consider pickling or canning.

## Common Problems When Growing Beetroot

| Problem | Cause | Quick Fix |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Split roots** | Inconsistent watering during maturity | Water deeply and evenly; account for recent or expected rainfall |
| **Tough roots** | Harvested too late | Pick up roots when they’re still young and tender |
| **Small roots** | Over‑sowing or over‑fertilizing | Thin seedlings; avoid fertilizing to prevent excessive foliage |
| **Bolting** | Extreme weather or early sowing | Wait until after frost danger or very hot periods; keep plants well‑watered |
| **Slugs & snails** | Night‑time feeders | Remove hiding spots, use poultry, torchlight traps, or slug traps |
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Wet spots that dry into scabs | Water at soil level, discard fallen leaves/fruit, practice crop rotation |
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow/grey‑brown patches, especially undersides | Water at soil level, remove affected leaves, avoid overcrowding; try homemade milk spray or fungicide |
| **Boron deficiency** | Yellow leaf tips, hollow stems, soft brown root centers | Mix **1 tbsp household boron** in **5 L water**; apply when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall. *Do not use as a general fertilizer—boron can be toxic.* |
