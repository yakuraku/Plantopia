# How to Grow Wallflower Seeds

**Family:** Brassicaceae  
**Binomial name:** *Cheiranthus cheiri*  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial  

## Preparation

Wallflowers are notorious for self‑seeding. At the end of the season they drop seeds that can germinate the next year without any help.  
- **Choose a welcoming spot**: If you want them to thrive, pick a location that will receive at least **3 hours of full sun** each day.  
- **Keep them in check**: If you’d rather not have a wallflower invasion, **deadhead** the plants before they set seed or grow them in containers.  

### Soil & Site

- **Well‑drained, organic‑rich soil** is key.  
  1. Weed thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging or turning.  
  3. Add aged animal manure or compost.  
- Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- For container growers:  
  - Pick a variety suited to pots.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - **Minimum pot size:** 10 L (about 2.5 gal).  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Wallflower Seeds

Wallflower seeds are *easy*—no soaking or stratification required.  
They do best when raised in trays or small pots and then transplanted.

1. **Fill** trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix (or soil starter pellets).  
2. **Sow** seeds **6 mm deep**.  
3. **Keep soil moist**—never soggy or dry.  
4. **Germination**: 10–15 days at 18–21 °C (65–70 °F).  
5. **Transplant** seedlings once they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing**: Plant 30 cm (12 in) apart in the garden.

## How to Grow Wallflower

### Watering

- Water when the top **5 cm** of soil feels dry (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
- **Deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering is best.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra feed.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertilizer:  
  - *Slow‑release*: apply at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
  - *Liquid*: apply during flowering or fruiting, following the label’s rate and frequency.

### Flowering & Deadheading

- Wallflowers typically **flower in ~180 days** (about 6 months).  
- **Deadhead** regularly: use sharp secateurs or snips to cut fading or dead blooms just above a leaf set.  
- Removing spent flowers encourages more blooms.

## Common Problems When Growing Wallflowers

| Problem | What to Look For | Quick Fix |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Irregular brown spots that dry into scab‑like patches; leaves and flowers may drop early. | Water at soil level, not on leaves. Dispose of fallen debris. Practice crop rotation. |
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level. Remove and destroy affected leaves. Avoid overcrowding; improve airflow. If persistent, try a homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Tender leaves and shoots eaten at night, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use torchlight to spot them, or set traps. |
