# How to Grow German Chamomile Seeds

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Matricaria recutita_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** German Chamomile thrives in **full sun** – aim for at least **6 hours of direct light** each day.  
- **Self‑seeding:** These plants will drop seed at season’s end. If you want them to *continue* growing, plant in a spot where new seedlings are welcome.  
  - *Tip:* If you prefer to keep them out, **deadhead** before seed drop or grow in containers.  
- **Soil:** Needs a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Weigh out the area, **weed** thoroughly, then **dig** to loosen.  
  - Add **aged animal manure** or **compost** for nutrients.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a variety suited for container growing.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Minimum **10 L** pot size recommended.  
  - Container plants may need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow German Chamomile Seeds

German Chamomile seeds require **no pre‑treatment** (no soaking or stratification).

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **1 mm deep** and **20–30 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist**—never water‑logged or dry. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–14 days** at **20–30 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **1 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist** soil, avoiding both wet and dry extremes. |
| 4 | Germinate in **7–14 days** at **20–30 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space out in the garden **20–30 cm apart**. |

> **Tip:** For a quick, informal method, *scatter* seeds over a lightly roughened surface, then lightly smooth the soil to cover them.

> **Tip:** Because the seeds are tiny, handle them gently to prevent loss. Mix with a little sand or fine potting mix, or use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly. Press lightly into the soil after sowing to ensure good contact. *Read more about sowing small seeds here.*

## How to Grow German Chamomile

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil is **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the **early morning** or **late afternoon**.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk. *Learn more about watering here.*  

- **Fertilising:**  
  - If the soil was well‑prepared, **no extra fertiliser** is usually needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flowering‑plant** fertiliser:  
    - **Slow‑release**: apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid**: apply at the recommended rate and frequency while plants are fruiting or flowering.  

- **Flowering:**  
  - German Chamomile typically **blooms in ~65 days**.  
  - Harvest when flowers are **fully open**: pinch the stem just below the flower head, leaving no stem attached.  
  - Flowers can be used **fresh** or **dried**.  
    - *Drying:* Spread in a single layer on a wire rack or paper towels, keep in a **dry, warm area** away from direct sunlight for **1–2 weeks**.  
    - Store dried flowers in a **sealed glass jar** for up to **six months**.  

- **Deadheading:**  
  - Regularly remove fading or dead flowers with sharp secateurs or snips, cutting just above a set of leaves.  
  - This encourages continuous blooming. *Learn more about deadheading flowering plants here.*

## Common Problems When Growing German Chamomile

| Problem | Symptoms | Management |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose to dislodge them. <br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray. <br>• Encourage predatory insects. <br>*Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; can reduce yield. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves. <br>• Ensure good airflow between plants. <br>• Remove affected leaves. <br>• If needed, spray with a suitable fungicide or homemade spray. <br>*Read more about powdery mildew here.* |
| **Thrips** | Black, beige, or white flying insects (<1.5 mm); larvae leave tiny white or transparent marks on leaves and petals. | • Wash plants with a garden hose. <br>• Encourage predatory mites and lacewings via companion planting. <br>• Spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |
