# How to Grow Hyssop Seeds

**Family:** Lamiaceae  
**Binomial name:** *Hyssopus officinalis*  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Hyssop loves *full sun* – aim for at least **6 hours of direct light** each day.  
- **Location:** As a perennial, it thrives when left undisturbed. Pick a permanent spot that won’t be dug up frequently.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs *excellent drainage*.  
  - No need for manure or heavy fertilisers; just **weed out** the area and **loosen** the soil.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, choose a variety suited for container life.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of at least **20 L** to give hyssop room to grow.  
  - Container plants may need a bit more fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Hyssop Seeds

Hyssop seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification required.

1. **Seed trays or pots**  
   - Fill with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sowing depth** – drop seeds **6 mm** deep.  
3. **Moisture** – keep the soil *moist but never soggy or dry*.  
4. **Germination** – expect 3–10 days at a soil temperature of **20–22 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting** – move seedlings outdoors once they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing** – plant 40–60 cm apart to give each plant room to spread.

## How to Grow Hyssop

### Watering

- Check the soil **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Water *deeply* in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
- Avoid wetting the leaves to keep fungal diseases at bay.

### Fertilising

- Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra feed.  
- If the soil is poor or you want a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release fertiliser** – apply at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
  - **Liquid fertiliser** – use during flowering or fruiting, following the recommended rate and frequency.

### Pruning

- After flowering, trim back to tidy the plant and stimulate new growth.  
- Use sharp secateurs or snips and cut stems just above a set of lower leaves.

## How to Harvest Hyssop

- Hyssop is ready in **90–95 days**.  
- Harvest by pinching off outer stems and leaves, leaving some on the plant for future growth.  
- **Short‑term storage:** place stems in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge or in a glass/jar of water.  
- **Long‑term storage:** dry the stems.

## Common Problems When Growing Hyssop

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Prevention & Fix |
|---------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves | • Water at soil level, not on foliage.<br>• Ensure good airflow.<br>• Remove affected leaves.<br>• Use a suitable fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Slimy trails, tender leaf damage, mainly at night | • Remove hiding spots.<br>• Keep free‑range poultry.<br>• Spot‑check with a torch at night.<br>• Use traps or natural deterrents. |
