  - Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen, and enrich with **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, pick a variety suited for container life.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot that’s **≥20 L** to give the plant room to grow.  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the season.

## How to Sow Garland Seeds

Garland seeds are simple to start—no soaking or stratification needed.

### Direct Sowing

1. **Plant** seeds **6 mm deep** in the garden.  
2. Space them **40 cm apart** with rows also **40 cm apart**.  
3. Keep the soil **moist but not soggy**.  
4. Germination takes **7–10 days** at **15–22 °C**.  
5. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raising Seedlings First

1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets).  
2. Sow seeds **6 mm deep**.  
3. Maintain **moist but not wet** soil.  
4. Germinate in **7–10 days** at **15–22 °C**.  
5. When seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**, transplant them.  
6. Space transplanted plants **40 cm apart** in rows **40 cm apart**.

> **Tip:** For a quick start, try the *scatter seed* method—roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil.

> **Optional:** In cooler climates, start seeds indoors **6 weeks before the last expected frost** in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Garland

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil feels **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil).  
  - Aim for **deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil was well‑prepared, extra fertilizer isn’t usually needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑nitrogen** or leafy‑green‑herb fertilizer:  
    - **Slow‑release**: apply at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid**: follow the recommended rate and frequency during the growing season.  

- **Thinning:**  
  - When seedlings are large enough to handle, thin them to **40 cm spacing** by pulling out weaker ones.  

- **Cutting for Flowers:**  
  - Use sharp snips or secateurs to cut the **longest stems**.  
  - Remove lower leaves and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.

## How to Harvest Garland

- **Timing:** Ready to harvest in **30–50 days**.  
- **Leaves:**  
  - Harvest when leaves are large enough to eat.  
  - Pinch off outer leaves, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
  - Whole plants can be cut at the base.  
  - Consume fresh or store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge for short‑term use.  
- **Flowers (Edible Only):**  
  - Harvest when fully open.  
  - Cut the stem to detach the flower.  
  - For fresh use, remove individual petals (the center disc can taste bitter).  
  - To dry, spread flowers on a wire rack until completely dry, then store in an airtight container.

## Common Problems When Growing Garland

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Why It Happens | Fix |
|---------|--------------------|----------------|-----|
| **Bitter Taste** | Leaves taste harsh | Slow growth, late harvest | Enrich soil with aged manure, water deeply and regularly, harvest young and tender leaves |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set | Extreme weather, early frost, heat stress | Sow after frost danger, water deeply during hot spells |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Slimy trails, chewed leaves | Nighttime feeding | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use traps or torchlight collection |
