# How to Grow Cosmos Seeds

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Cosmos sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

---

## Preparation

Cosmos are *self‑seeding* beauties. At the end of the season they drop seeds that can sprout the next year.  
- **Want them to stay wild?** Leave them alone; they’ll keep coming back.  
- **Want to keep them tidy?** Deadhead before seed drop or grow them in containers.

**Sun & Soil**  
- **Sun:** Full sun is essential – aim for **≥ 6 h of direct light** each day.  
- **Soil:** Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  1. Weed thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging or turning.  
  3. Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  4. Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

**Container Growing**  
- Choose a variety suited for pots.  
- Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
- **Minimum pot size:** 20 L (≈ 5 gal).  
- Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Cosmos Seeds

Cosmos seeds need no pre‑treatment (no soaking or stratification).  
You can **direct‑sow** in the garden or **raise seedlings** in trays and transplant later.

### Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **6 mm deep** and **45 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but not soggy**. |
| 3 | Germination: **15‑20 days** at **21‑26 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and weather until established. |

### Raising Seedlings

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **6 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Keep soil **moist but not soggy**. |
| 4 | Germination: **15‑20 days** at **21‑26 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5‑10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **45 cm apart** in the garden. |

**Tip:** Try the *scatter seed* method—roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil.  

**Optional:** In cooler climates, start seeds indoors **6 weeks before the last frost**. Keep them warm with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Cosmos

### Watering

- Water when the soil is dry **≈ 5 cm below the surface** (check by scratching a bit of soil).  
- **Best times:** Early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising

- **Well‑prepared soil:** No extra fertiliser needed.  
- **Poor soil or extra boost:** Use a high‑potassium or flowering‑plant fertiliser.  
  - **Slow‑release:** Apply at transplant or when seedlings are **5‑10 cm tall**.  
  - **Liquid:** Apply during fruiting or flowering as per label.

### Pruning & Pinching

- Pinch off the growing tips to encourage **denser growth**, **stronger stems**, and **more flowers**.  
- Use sharp secateurs or snips; cut just above a set of lower leaves.

### Flowering Time

- Cosmos typically flower in **80‑100 days**.

### Cut‑Flower Tips

- Cut the longest stems with sharp snips or secateurs.  
- Remove lower leaves and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.  

### Deadheading

- Regularly remove faded or dead flowers just above a set of leaves.  
- This encourages continuous blooming.

## Common Problems When Growing Cosmos

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2‑4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; may leave honeydew attracting ants. | • Spray with a garden hose. <br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray. <br>• Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium Wilt** | Soil‑borne fungi that block water/nutrient flow; leaves wilt, dry, yellow, and may die. | • No cure; prevent by choosing resistant varieties. <br>• Dispose of infected plants and soil. <br>• Practice good hygiene and crop rotation. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; can reduce yield. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves. <br>• Ensure good airflow. <br>• Remove affected leaves. <br>• Use appropriate fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Thrips** | Tiny black/beige/white flying insects (<1.5 mm); larvae leave small white or transparent marks on leaves and petals. | • Wash with a garden hose. <br>• Encourage predatory mites and lacewings via companion planting. <br>• Spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |
