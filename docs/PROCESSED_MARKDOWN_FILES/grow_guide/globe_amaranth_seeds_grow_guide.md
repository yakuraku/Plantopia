## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Globe Amaranth loves *full sun*. Pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of direct sunshine** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Start by **weeding** the area, then **dig it over** to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost** for a nutrient boost.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, choose a variety labeled **“container‑friendly.”**  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot that’s **at least 20 L** in volume.  
  - Remember: container plants often need a little extra fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Globe Amaranth Seeds

Globe Amaranth seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking or stratification required. You can plant them straight in the garden or start them indoors and transplant later.

### 1. Direct Sowing

1. **Plant** seeds **5 mm deep** and **50 cm apart**.  
2. Keep the soil **moist but never soggy or dry**.  
3. Germination takes **14–21 days** at a soil temperature of **20–25 °C**.  
4. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### 2. Raising Seedlings

1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **good seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets).  
2. Sow seeds **5 mm deep**.  
3. Maintain **consistent moisture**—not too wet, not too dry.  
4. Germination: **14–21 days** at **20–25 °C**.  
5. **Transplant** when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. Space the transplanted plants **50 cm apart**.

> **Tip:** Globe Amaranth is frost‑sensitive. **Wait until all danger of frost has passed** before sowing or transplanting outdoors.

## How to Grow Globe Amaranth

- **Watering:**  
  - Check the soil **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - **Avoid wetting the leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, no extra fertilizer is needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertilizer.  
    - **Slow‑release**: apply at transplant or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
    - **Liquid**: apply during flowering or fruiting, following the label’s rate and frequency.  
- **Pinching:**  
  - To encourage denser growth and stronger stems, **pinch off the top set of leaves** just above a lower leaf set using sharp secateurs or snips.  
- **Flowering Time:**  
  - Expect blooms in **80–90 days** from sowing.  
- **Cut Flowers:**  
  - Use sharp snips to cut the **longest stems** possible.  
  - Remove lower leaves and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.  
- **Deadheading:**  
  - Regularly trim fading or dead flowers **just above a leaf** to promote more blooms.  
- **Drying Flowers:**  
  - Cut several stems, strip the leaves, tie them together, and hang the bundle upside down in a cool, dry spot until fully dry.

## Common Problems When Growing Globe Amaranth

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Frost Damage** | Leaves wilt and turn black. | Wait until all frost risk is gone before planting; prune damaged leaves to prevent rot. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow to grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level (not on leaves), remove and destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding, and consider a homemade milk spray or fungicide if needed. |
