Allium (flowering onion) thrives in **full sun**—aim for at least **6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
For a healthy root system, choose a **loose, well‑drained soil** enriched with organic matter:

- **Weed** the area thoroughly.
- **Dig** to a depth of at least a spade’s depth to loosen the soil.
- **Add** aged animal manure or compost to lighten heavy soils and boost fertility.
- Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.

*Tip:* A well‑prepared bed means you’ll rarely need extra fertiliser.

## How to Plant Onion (Flowering Onion) Bulbs

Plant bulbs **directly** in their final spot—garden bed or container.

1. **Space** each bulb **15–20 cm apart**.  
2. **Depth:** Plant **three times the bulb’s height** with the pointed tip facing **upwards**.  
3. **Cover** with soil and give a good **watering**.  
4. **Moisture:** Keep the soil damp but not waterlogged until shoots appear.

## How to Grow Allium (Flowering Onion)

### Watering

- Check the soil **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
- **Avoid** wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilising

If your soil is already rich, skip extra fertiliser.  
For poorer soils or a boost:

- **Slow‑release** fertilizer: apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm tall**.  
- **Liquid** fertilizer: apply at the recommended rate and frequency while the plants are **fruiting or flowering**.  
- Choose a high‑potassium or flowering‑plant formula.

### Flowering & Harvest

- Expect **flower spikes** in **180–200 days**.  
- As flowers emerge, the foliage will naturally die back.  

#### Cutting for Cut Flowers

- Use **sharp snips or secateurs** to cut the longest stems.  
- Place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.  
- Dried flower heads can be cut once they turn **straw‑coloured**.

#### Post‑Flowering Care

- After flowering, trim flower spikes and individual leaves at ground level with sharp tools.

### Bulb Longevity

- Bulbs can stay in the ground for **several years**—no need to lift and divide.  
- **Mulch heavily** to shield bulbs from scorching summer heat.  
- In wet summers or if the beds become overcrowded, **lift and store** bulbs for the next season.

## Common Problems When Growing Allium (Flowering Onion)

| Problem | Description | Management |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides. They can wilt leaves and excrete honeydew that attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray<br>• Encourage predatory insects |
| **Rotten bulbs or corms** | Caused by pathogens in cold, wet soil or warm winter temperatures. Symptoms: rot, no roots/shoots, stunted yellow leaves, no flowers. | • Plant in well‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers<br>• Do not water during dormancy<br>• Lift and store if your climate calls for it |
| **Slugs & snails** | Molluscs that feed on tender leaves, leaving slimy trails, especially at night. | • Remove hiding places<br>• Keep free‑range poultry<br>• Use torchlight to collect<br>• Set traps |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._) | Brown to orange raised spots or patches on foliage. Spreads by wind or water, thrives at 10–20 °C with high humidity. | • Space plants to avoid overcrowding<br>• Provide full sun<br>• Avoid over‑fertilising<br>• Remove dead plants and practice crop rotation |
| **Onion thrips** (_Thrips tabaci_) | Tiny flying insects (<1.5 mm) that suck sap, leaving silver patches and reducing yield. They hide in inner leaves and leaf folds, and may infest bulbs. | • Wash plants with a garden hose<br>• Spread organic mulch<br>• Encourage predatory mites and lacewings with companion planting |
