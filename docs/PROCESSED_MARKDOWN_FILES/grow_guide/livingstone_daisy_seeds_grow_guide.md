# How to Grow Livingstone Daisy Seeds

**Family:** Aizoaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Dorotheanthus bellidiformis_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Plant in a spot that receives **at least 6 h of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:** Needs a **very well‑drained** mix.  
  - No extra manure or fertiliser is usually required.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area and dig the soil to loosen it.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a pot that’s **recommended for container growing**.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Minimum size: **10 L** to accommodate mature plants.  
  - During the growing season, container plants may need a little extra fertiliser to stay healthy.

## How to Sow Livingstone Daisy Seeds

Livingstone Daisy seeds are **easy to handle**—no soaking or stratification needed.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **3 mm deep** and **15 cm apart** in the garden. |
| 2 | Keep the soil **moist but never water‑logged**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–14 days** at a soil temperature of **15–25 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **good quality seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **3 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist but not wet** soil. |
| 4 | Germination: **7–14 days** at **15–25 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **15 cm apart** when planting out. |

> **Tip:** Livingstone Daisy is a **half‑hardy** crop. Mature plants tolerate light frosts, but seedlings need protection until they’re established. **Never sow or transplant before the last frost.**

### Scatter‑Seed Method

If you prefer a quick, informal approach:

1. Roughen the soil surface.  
2. **Scatter seeds evenly** over the area.  
3. Lightly smooth the soil to cover the seeds.  
4. Press gently to ensure good seed‑soil contact.

> **Tip:** Seeds are tiny—handle them with care to prevent them from blowing away or washing off.  
> Mix seeds with a little sand or fine potting mix before sowing, or use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly.  
> Keep the soil from drying out.

## How to Grow Livingstone Daisy

- **Watering:**  
  - Once established, these plants are **drought tolerant**.  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings; only water when the soil is dry **10 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- **Fertiliser:**  
  - They thrive in **nutrient‑poor soils** and usually need **no additional fertiliser** during the growing season.  
- **Flowering:**  
  - Expect first blooms in **≈140 days**.  
- **Deadheading:**  
  - Regularly remove faded or dead flowers with sharp secateurs or snips, cutting just above a set of leaves.  
  - This encourages more blooms.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Handle It |
|---------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage natural predators. |
| **Grey Mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Mouldy flowers and rotting fruit; spores spread by wind, survive in soil or green waste; thrives in cool, damp weather. | • Prune affected flowers and fruit.<br>• Water at soil level, not on leaves.<br>• Apply a suitable fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves and shoots, especially at night; leave slimy trails. | • Remove hiding places.<br>• Keep free‑range poultry.<br>• Spot‑collect by torchlight or use traps. |
