**Life Cycle:** Perennial

## Preparation

Bluebells thrive in **full sun to part shade**—aim for at least **3 hours of direct sunlight** each day. They love the dappled shade beneath deciduous trees, which keeps their roots cool and moist.

### Soil

- **Loose, well‑drained** mix enriched with organic matter.  
- Weeding first: remove all weeds, then dig the soil to at least a **spade’s depth**.  
- Add **aged animal manure or compost** to lighten heavy soils and give roots room to grow.  
- Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

> *Tip:* If you’re unsure how to prepare your soil, check out our guide on **soil preparation for planting**.

### Containers

- Bluebells can grow in pots—pick a variety labeled **“container‑friendly.”**  
- Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of at least **10 L**.  
- Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season to stay healthy.

## How to Plant Bluebell Bulbs

Plant bulbs **directly** in their final spot, whether in the garden or a container.

1. **Space** each bulb **10 cm apart**.  
2. Dig a hole **7 cm deep** and place the bulb with the **pointed tip up**.  
3. Cover with soil and **water well**.  
4. Keep the soil **moist but not soggy** until shoots appear.

## Growing & Caring

### Watering

- Check soil moisture **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising

- If the soil is already well‑prepared, skip extra fertiliser.  
- In poorer soils or for a nutrient boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertiliser:

  * **Slow‑release**: apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm** tall.  
  * **Liquid**: apply during flowering or fruiting, following the product’s recommended rate and frequency.

### Flowering

- Expect blooms in **90–120 days**.  
- For cut flowers, snip the **longest stems** with sharp scissors or secateurs, remove lower leaves, and place immediately in clean water.

### Post‑Flower Care

- Let foliage **die back naturally** after flowering; the bulb reabsorbs nutrients for next season.  
- Once all leaves have browned, trim them at ground level with sharp tools.

### Longevity & Mulching

- Bluebell bulbs can stay in the ground for years—no need to lift and divide unless overcrowded or you want to relocate them.  
- **Mulch heavily** over the bulbs during hot summer months to protect them from extreme heat.  
- In wet summers, consider lifting bulbs to prevent rot.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects (ladybugs, lacewings) |
| **Rotten bulbs/corms** | Bulbs show rot, lack roots or shoots, produce stunted yellow leaves, no flowers | Plant in **free‑draining soil**, raised beds, or containers; avoid watering during dormancy; lift and store bulbs if climate is wet |
