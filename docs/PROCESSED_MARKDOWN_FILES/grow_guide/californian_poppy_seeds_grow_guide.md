# How to Grow Californian Poppy Seeds

**Family:** Papaveraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Eschscholzia californica_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

The Californian poppy is a bright, low‑maintenance flower that thrives in sunny, dry spots. With a few simple steps, you can enjoy a burst of color in your garden or a charming container display.

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Plant in a spot that receives **at least 6 hours of full sun** each day.  
- **Self‑seeding:** These poppies often drop seed at season’s end.  
  - *Want them to stay in the garden?* Leave the seed drop.  
  - *Prefer to keep them out?* Deadhead before seed set or grow in containers.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs **very well‑drained** soil.  
  - No extra manure or fertilizer is usually required.  
  - **Weed** thoroughly, then loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a variety suited for container growing.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of at least **20 L**.  
  - Container plants may benefit from a light fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Californian Poppy Seeds

These seeds are easy to handle—no soaking or stratification needed. You can sow them directly in the garden or raise seedlings first.

### 1. Direct Sowing

1. **Depth & Spacing** – Sow **3 mm deep** and **15–30 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture** – Keep soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
3. **Germination** – Expect **14–21 days** at **16–21 °C** soil temperature.  
4. **Protection** – Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### 2. Raising Seedlings

1. **Containers** – Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sowing** – Plant **3 mm deep**.  
3. **Moisture** – Maintain the same moist‑but‑not‑wet rule.  
4. **Germination** – Same **14–21 days** at **16–21 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting** – Move seedlings when they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing** – Plant out **15–30 cm apart**.

> **Tip:** If you’re in a hurry, try the *scatter seed* method: roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil.

## How to Grow Californian Poppy

- **Watering**  
  - Once established, these poppies are drought‑tolerant.  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings; check by scratching 10 cm below the surface.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to prevent fungal issues.  
- **Fertilizing**  
  - They thrive in **nutrient‑poor** soil; no extra fertilizer is needed during the season.  
- **Thinning**  
  - When seedlings are large enough, thin them to **15–30 cm spacing** by pulling out weaker ones.  
- **Flowering**  
  - Expect blooms in **60–80 days**.  
- **Deadheading**  
  - Regularly cut fading or dead flowers just above a leaf set with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - This encourages more blooms.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Grey mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Mouldy flowers, rotting fruit | Prune affected parts, water at soil level, consider a fungicide or homemade spray |
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown leaf patches, especially undersides | Water at soil level, remove/destroy affected leaves, ensure good airflow, use milk spray or fungicide if needed |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots spreading across leaves | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, apply fungicide or homemade spray if necessary |
