# How to Grow Lettuce Seeds

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Lactuca sativa_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Choose a spot that gets **at least 3 h of full sun** each day. Lettuce also tolerates part shade, but full sun gives the best growth.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, then dig or till to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost** to boost fertility.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Container growing:**  
  - Pick a variety that’s **recommended for containers**.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Containers should be **at least 10 L** (≈ 2.6 gal) to give mature plants enough room.  
  - Remember that container plants often need **extra fertiliser** during the growing season.

## How to Sow Lettuce Seeds

Lettuce seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking or stratification needed. You can sow them directly in the garden or raise seedlings in trays and transplant later.

### Sow Direct

1. **Plant** seeds **5 mm deep** and **20–50 cm apart**.  
2. Keep the soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
3. Germination takes **7–14 days** at a soil temperature of **8–23 °C**.  
4. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raise Seedlings

1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **good quality seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets).  
2. Sow seeds **5 mm deep**.  
3. Maintain **moist but not soggy** soil.  
4. Germinate in **7–14 days** at **8–23 °C**.  
5. Transplant when seedlings have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. Space transplanted plants **20–50 cm apart**.

> **Loose‑leaf tip:** For a quick, informal crop, simply **scatter** seeds over a lightly roughened surface, then lightly cover with soil.

## How to Grow Lettuce

- **Watering:**  
  - Check the soil 5 cm below the surface; water when it feels dry.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  

- **Thinning:**  
  - Once seedlings are large enough to handle, **pull out** weak or small ones.  
  - Aim for a final spacing of **20–50 cm**.

- **Fertilising:**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, **no extra fertiliser** is usually needed.  
  - In poorer soil or to give a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid** fertilizer at the recommended rate and frequency during the growing season.

## How to Harvest Lettuce

- **Timing:** Lettuce is ready in **≈ 40–90 days** after sowing.  
- **Loose‑leaf varieties:**  
  - Harvest when leaves are **large enough to eat**.  
  - Pinch off outer leaves, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
- **Head‑forming varieties:**  
  - Wait until a tight head has formed.  
  - Cut the whole head at ground level.  
- **Post‑harvest:**  
  - Consume fresh as soon as possible.  
  - Store leaves in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge for short‑term freshness.

## Common Problems When Growing Lettuce

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Control |
|---------|--------------------|----------------|
| **Slugs & Snails** | Night‑time feeders leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, use traps, or spot‑treat with a safe slug bait. |
| **Damping Off** | Seeds fail to germinate or seedlings rot at the base. | Use fresh potting mix for seedlings, avoid over‑watering, keep foliage dry, and ensure good drainage. |
| **Whitefly** | Yellowing or wilting leaves, often in dense clouds on the underside. | Rinse with a garden hose, spray with a mild soap solution, or encourage natural predators. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed production. | Sow after the last frost, avoid extreme heat, water deeply and regularly to reduce heat stress. |
| **Heads Not Forming** | Lettuce fails to develop a tight head, often in warm weather. | Confirm you’re growing a head‑forming type, water consistently, and apply compost or fertilizer. |
| **Bitter Taste** | Leaves taste harsh, especially if harvested late. | Enrich soil with aged manure, water deeply and regularly, and harvest when leaves are young and tender. |
