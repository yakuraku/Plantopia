**Family:** Apiaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Coriandrum sativum_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Choose a spot that gets **at least 3 h of full sun** each day.

  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, dig over, and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, pick a variety suited to container life.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot that holds **≥10 L** for mature plants.  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertiliser to stay healthy.  

## How to Sow Coriander Seeds  

Coriander seeds are *straightforward* – no soaking or stratification needed.  

1. **Direct sow**:  
   - 6 mm deep, 20 cm apart.  
   - Rows 20 cm apart.  
2. **Watering:** Keep soil **moist but never soggy**.  
3. **Germination:** 7–14 days at **18–21 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  

**Tips**  
- Avoid sowing in very hot weather; coriander will bolt.  
- In cool climates, wait until all frost danger has passed.  
- *Scatter seed* method works too: roughen the soil, scatter seeds, then lightly cover.  

## How to Grow Coriander  

- **Watering:**  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Keep soil evenly moist; never let it dry out.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  
- **Fertilising:**  
  - If soil is already rich, skip extra fertiliser.  
  - For a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release** at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - **Liquid** during the growing season, following the product’s rate.  
- **Thinning:** Once seedlings are sturdy, pull out weak ones so plants are **~20 cm apart**.  
- **Leaf vs. Seed Production:**  
  - *Leaves:* Pinch off outer leaves as needed; leave some for regrowth.  
  - *Roots:* Harvest when roots are large enough; pull gently or use a fork.  
  - *Seeds:* Let the plant flower fully; then dry seed heads before harvesting.  

## How to Harvest Coriander  

- **Timing:** Roughly **30–45 days** after sowing.  
- **Leaves:**  
  - Harvest when leaves are large enough to eat.  
  - Pinch off outer leaves, leaving a few for the plant.  
  - Store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge for short‑term use.  
- **Roots:**  
  - Pull at the base or lift with a fork.  
  - Consume soon after; store similarly to leaves.  
- **Seeds:**  
  - Wait until seed heads are dry and have turned from green to beige.  
  - Remove the head, discard the plant, and dry in a cool, airy spot.  
  - Store in an airtight container.  

## Common Problems When Growing Coriander  

| Problem | What Happens | How to Avoid / Fix |
|---------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set. | Avoid sowing during extreme heat or frost danger. Keep plants well‑watered and cool. |
| **Frost Damage** | Leaves wilt and turn black. | Plant only after all frost risk has passed. Harvest before winter and prune damaged leaves. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Feed on tender shoots, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep poultry, use traps or torchlight to catch them. *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
