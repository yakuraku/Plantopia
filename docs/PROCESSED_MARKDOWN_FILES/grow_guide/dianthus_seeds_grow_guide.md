# How to Grow Dianthus Seeds

**Family:** Caryophyllaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Dianthus sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial, sometimes grown as an annual  

---

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Dianthus loves *full sun* – aim for at least **6 hours a day**.  
- **Location:** Pick a *permanent spot* so the plants can grow undisturbed; they’re perennials.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs **well‑drained** soil rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen (dig or till), and enrich with **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re container‑growing, choose a variety suited for pots.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of at least **10 L**.  
  - Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Dianthus Seeds

Dianthus seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification required.

1. **Start indoors** in trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sow** at a depth of **3 mm**.  
3. **Moisture:** Keep the soil *moist but never waterlogged*.  
4. **Germination:**  
   - 7–14 days at a soil temperature of **18–22 °C**.  
5. **Transplant:**  
   - Move seedlings outdoors once they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
   - Space plants **20–50 cm apart**.

## How to Grow Dianthus

### Watering  
- Water when the top **5 cm** of soil feels dry (check by finger).  
- **Deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering is best.  
- Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilising  
- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra feed.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - **Liquid** fertilizer during flowering or fruiting, following the product’s rate and frequency.

### Pruning & Pinching  
- **Pinch** the growing tips to promote denser growth, stronger stems, and more blooms.  
  - Use sharp secateurs or snips; cut just above a lower leaf set.  
- **Deadheading:** Remove faded flowers just above a leaf set to encourage more blooms.  
- **Post‑flowering prune** to tidy and stimulate new growth.  
- **Cut‑flower care:** For stems, cut the longest ones with sharp tools, remove lower leaves, and place immediately in clean water.

### Flowering  
- Dianthus typically blooms in **180–200 days**.

## Common Problems When Growing Dianthus

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, soap/alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Brown, wet‑looking spots that dry to scab‑like patches; leaves/flowers drop early. | Water at soil level, discard fallen debris, practice crop rotation. |
| **Grey mould (Botrytis)** | Mouldy flowers, rotting fruit; spores spread by wind, thrive in cool, damp weather. | Prune affected parts, water at soil level, use fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium wilt** | Root‑borne fungi cause wilting, yellowing, and eventual death. | No cure; use resistant varieties, discard infected material, maintain good hygiene, rotate crops. |
| **Rust (Puccinia)** | Brown/orange raised spots on foliage; spreads by wind/water, prefers 10–20 °C and high humidity. | Space plants, ensure full sun, avoid over‑fertilising, remove dead plants, rotate crops. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves at night, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, use poultry, night‑time traps, or torchlight collection. |
| **Thrips** | Tiny flying insects (<1.5 mm); larvae leave small white or transparent marks on leaves and petals. | Hose off affected plants, encourage predatory mites/lacewings, use soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |
