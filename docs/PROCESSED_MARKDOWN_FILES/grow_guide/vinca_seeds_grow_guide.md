**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

---

## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot** – Vinca is a perennial, so pick a location that won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Sunlight:** Full sun to part shade. Aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, loosen with a fork or tiller, then mix in aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Use a variety rated for container growing.  
  - Minimum pot size: **10 L** (about 2.5 gal).  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Container plants may need extra fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Vinca Seeds

Vinca seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking, stratification, or special treatment required.

### 1. Sow Directly in the Garden

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sprinkle seeds **2 mm deep** and **30 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but never waterlogged**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **10–15 days** at **24–26 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raise Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **2 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain moist soil (never wet or dry). |
| 4 | Germinate in **10–15 days** at **24–26 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space planted seedlings **30 cm apart**. |

> **Tip:** Vinca is frost‑sensitive. **Never sow or transplant outdoors** until after the last frost.  
> In cooler climates, start indoors **6 weeks before the expected last frost** in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Vinca

- **Watering:**  
  - Once established, Vinca is drought‑tolerant.  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings; check by scratching a 10 cm depth with your finger.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to prevent fungal diseases.  

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
  - For poorer soil or a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release** fertilizer (high‑potassium or flowering‑plant formula) at transplant or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
    - **Liquid** fertilizer during fruiting or flowering, following the recommended rate and frequency.  

- **Pruning & Pinching:**  
  - Pinch back the top set of leaves (just above a lower leaf) with sharp secateurs or snips to encourage denser growth, stronger stems, and more flowers.  
  - After flowering (≈ 85 days), prune back to tidy the plant and stimulate new growth.

## Common Problems When Growing Vinca

| Problem | Symptoms | Management |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium Wilt** | Soil‑borne fungi block water/nutrient flow; leaves/branches wilt, dry, yellow, and die. | • No cure; prevent by choosing resistant varieties.<br>• Dispose of infected plants and soil.<br>• Practice good hygiene and crop rotation. |
| **Root Rot** | Slow establishment, yellowing or wilted foliage, soft brown tissue at stem base/roots; often fatal. | • Remove and discard affected plants.<br>• Reduce soil moisture.<br>• Add organic matter.<br>• Keep mulch away from stems. |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insects on leaf undersides; yellowing leaves, wilting, stunted growth; swarm when disturbed. | • Hose spray or soap spray.<br>• Destroy severely affected plants.<br>• Attract beneficial insects that prey on whitefly. |

> **Pro Tip:** Regularly inspect your plants for early signs of pests or disease. Early intervention saves time and keeps your Vinca healthy and vibrant.
