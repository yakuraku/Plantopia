# How to Grow Gladiolus Corms  

**Family:** Iridaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Gladiolus grandiflorus_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Gladiolus loves *full sun* – aim for at least **6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Wind protection:** Their tall, slender spikes can break in strong winds. Plant in a *sheltered spot* or add a windbreak.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **loose, well‑drained** mix enriched with organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, then dig to a **spade’s depth** (≈30 cm) to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure** or compost to lighten heavy soils and boost fertility.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting to give roots room to grow.

## How to Plant Gladiolus Corms  

1. **Spacing & depth** – Plant each corm **15 cm apart** and **10 cm deep** with the tip pointing upward.  
2. **Cover & water** – Fill in with soil and water well.  
3. **Moisture** – Keep the soil **moist but not soggy** until shoots appear.

## Growing Gladiolus  

### Watering  
- **When to water:** Test the soil 5 cm below the surface; if it feels dry, it’s time.  
- **How to water:** Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon to reduce evaporation.  
- **Avoid leaf wetting:** Keep water off the foliage to prevent fungal diseases.

### Staking  
- **Why stake:** The tall spikes need support.  
- **When to stake:** Place a sturdy stake **before** planting to avoid disturbing roots.  
- **How to tie:** Use twine or plant ties, gently securing stems as they grow.

### Flowering  
- Expect blooms in **90–120 days** after planting.

### Cutting for Flowers  
- Use **sharp snips** or secateurs to cut the longest stems.  
- Remove lower leaves and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.

## Long‑Term Care & Storage  

- **Naturalising:** In most climates, gladiolus corms can stay in the garden for years.  
- **Winter protection:**  
  - *Mild frost areas:* Apply a thick mulch layer in autumn.  
  - *Heavy/frequent frost areas:* Lift and store corms over winter.  

### Lifting & Storing  
1. Wait until foliage turns **yellow**.  
2. Cut foliage at ground level.  
3. Use a garden fork to lift corms, handling them gently.  
4. Spread on a wire rack in a **cool, dry** spot for **10–14 days** to dry.  
5. Store in a net bag until replanting.

## Common Problems & Solutions  

| Problem | Symptoms | Management |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose<br>• Use soap or alcohol spray<br>• Encourage predatory insects |
| **Rotten corms** | Corms show rot, lack roots or shoots; often due to cold, wet soil or over‑soaking. | • Don’t soak corms longer than recommended<br>• Plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers<br>• Lift and store over winter if grown perennials |
| **Thrips** | Tiny black/beige/white insects (<1.5 mm); larvae leave small white or transparent marks on leaves and petals. | • Wash with a garden hose<br>• Encourage predatory mites and lacewings via companion planting<br>• Spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves and shoots, mainly at night; leave slimy trails. | • Remove hiding places<br>• Keep free‑range poultry<br>• Collect by torchlight or use traps |
