# How to Grow Okra Seeds

**Family:** Malvaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Abelmoschus esculentus_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial (grown as an annual in cool climates)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Okra loves *full sun* – pick a spot that gets at least **6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Choose a well‑drained bed rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, then loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  - Mix in aged animal manure or compost to boost fertility.  
- Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

## How to Sow Okra Seeds

Okra seeds are straightforward – no soaking or stratification needed.  
You can either sow them directly in the garden or raise seedlings in trays and transplant later.

### Sow Direct

1. **Planting depth & spacing** – sow seeds **10 mm deep**, **60 cm apart**, with rows **100 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture** – keep soil consistently moist, but never *wet* or *dry*.  
3. **Germination** – seeds sprout in **12–14 days** when soil temperatures hit **23–33 °C**.  
4. **Protection** – shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raise Seedlings

1. **Containers** – use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots filled with a high‑quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Planting** – sow seeds **10 mm deep**.  
3. **Moisture** – maintain the same moist‑but‑not‑wet rule.  
4. **Germination** – expect **12–14 days** at **23–33 °C**.  
5. **Transplant** – move seedlings to the garden once they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing** – plant out at **60 cm apart**, rows **100 cm apart**.

> **Tip:** Okra is a tender crop that’s sensitive to frost. *Do not transplant seedlings or sow seeds outside until all danger of frost has passed.*

## How to Grow Okra

- **Watering** – water when the soil is dry about **5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
  - Water *deeply* in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - **Avoid wetting the leaves** to prevent fungal diseases.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*

- **Fertilising** – if the soil was well prepared, extra fertiliser isn’t usually needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - *Apply a slow‑release fertiliser* at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings are **5–10 cm tall**.  
    - *Apply a liquid fertiliser* at the recommended rate and frequency while plants are fruiting or flowering.

## How to Harvest Okra

- **Timing** – pods are ready in **55–65 days**.  
- **Size** – harvest when pods are **8–10 cm long**; larger pods become tough and stringy.  
- **Method** – cut pods with snips or secateurs.  
- **Frequency** – harvest regularly to encourage more pods.  
- **Storage** – best eaten fresh; can be kept a few days in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.

## Common Problems When Growing Okra

Below are the most frequent issues and how to tackle them:

**Aphids** – small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects that cluster on new shoots or leaf undersides.  
- Symptoms: wilting, discoloration, honeydew (attracts ants).  
- Control: spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects.  
- *Read more about aphids here.*

**Bacterial leaf spot** – irregular brown spots that dry into scab‑like patches.  
- Symptoms: premature leaf and flower drop.  
- Prevention: water at soil level, discard fallen leaves/fruit, practice crop rotation.

**Damping off** – fungal infection from soil to seeds/seedlings.  
- Symptoms: seeds fail to germinate; seedlings rot at the base.  
- Prevention: use fresh potting mix, avoid watering foliage, keep soil from becoming waterlogged.  
- *Read more about damping off here.*

**Frost damage** – leaves wilt and turn black.  
- Prevention: wait until all frost danger has passed before planting; harvest before winter.  
- Remedy: prune damaged leaves to prevent rot.

**Fusarium wilt & Verticillium wilt** – soil‑borne fungi that clog roots, blocking water and nutrients.  
- Symptoms: wilting, yellowing, branch dieback.  
- No cure: choose resistant varieties, remove affected plants and soil, maintain good hygiene, rotate crops.

**Powdery mildew** – white fungal spores that spread across leaves.  
- Symptoms: white spots that can cover entire leaves.  
- Prevention: water at soil level, ensure good airflow, remove affected leaves.  
- Treatment: apply suitable fungicide or homemade spray.  
- *Read more about powdery mildew here.*

**Spider mites** – tiny (Tetranychus urticae) sap‑suckers that dry and discolor leaves.  
- Symptoms: fine sandpaper feel on leaf undersides.  
- Control: prune for airflow, spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulphur.
