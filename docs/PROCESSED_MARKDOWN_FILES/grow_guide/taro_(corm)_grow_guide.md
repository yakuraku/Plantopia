## Planting & Growing Taro Corms

### 1. In the Ground  
- **Depth & Spacing:** Plant each corm **5 cm deep** and **60–90 cm apart** in well‑prepared soil.  
- **Cover:** Lightly backfill with soil and firm gently.

### 2. In Pots  
- **Pot size:** Use a pot **50–60 cm deep** with a similar diameter.  
- **Drainage:** Ensure at least one drainage hole.  
- **Planting:** Place **one corm per pot** at the centre, 5 cm deep, and cover lightly with potting mix.

### 3. Watering  
- **Immediately after planting:** Water thoroughly.  
- **Throughout the season:** Keep the soil consistently moist.  
- **Avoid drought stress:** Dry soil reduces corm production.

### 4. Mulching & Fertilising  
- **Mulch:** Apply a layer on the soil surface to suppress weeds and lock in moisture.  
- **First fertiliser:** About **6–8 weeks after planting**, give each plant an all‑purpose organic fertiliser.  
- **Soil quality:**  
  - *Well‑prepared soil* → no extra fertiliser needed.  
  - *Poor soil or extra boost* → use a balanced fertiliser:  
    - **Slow‑release** at the recommended rate.  
    - **Liquid** during spring and summer at the recommended frequency.  
- **Potted plants:** May require more regular fertilising.

## Harvesting Taro

- **Timing:** Taro takes **6–9 months** to mature. Harvest when the leaves start to die back in autumn.  
- **Method:** Use a fork to carefully dig up the corms.  
- **Storage:** Corms are best used within **one month** of harvest.  
- **Cooking:** **Always cook before eating**. Options: boiled, steamed, baked, or fried.

## Common Problems & How to Handle Them

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** (2–4 mm) | New shoots, undersides of leaves; wilting, discoloration; honeydew attracts ants | Spray with water, soap or alcohol solution; encourage natural predators |
| **Mealybugs** (_Pseudococcidae_) (3–6 mm) | White‑cotton coating, wilting, honeydew | Wipe leaves, soap/alcohol spray, attract predators |
| **Rotten Corms** | Corms rot, no roots/shoots; caused by cold, wet soil or waterlogging | Do not soak corms too long; plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers; lift and store over winter if perennials |
| **Crown Rot** | Brown lower stems/branches, plant dies from bottom up | Reduce soil moisture, avoid overwatering, ensure good drainage, use raised beds or containers |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Night‑time feeding, slimy trails | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, use traps or torchlight collection |
| **Whitefly** | Yellowing leaves, wilting, slow growth; swarms on leaf undersides | Hose spray, soap spray; destroy severely affected plants; attract beneficial insects |
