**Family:** Liliaceae  
**Binomial name:** *Muscari armeniacum*  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial

## 1. Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Muscari thrives in **full sun or part shade**. Aim for at least **3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Location:** A spot under deciduous trees works well—dappled shade in summer and full sun in winter.  
- **Permanent Placement:** Once established, Muscari can be hard to eradicate. Pick a **permanent bed** or grow in **containers** to keep them from spreading.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Loose, well‑drained, enriched with organic matter.  
  - Weeding, then dig to at least a spade’s depth.  
  - Add aged animal manure or compost to lighten heavy soils.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Container Growing:**  
  - Choose a variety suited for pots.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Minimum pot size: **10 L**.  
  - Container plants may need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## 2. Planting Muscari Bulbs

Plant bulbs **directly** in their final spot (garden or container).

1. **Spacing & Depth**  
   - 5–8 cm apart.  
   - 5 cm deep, pointed tip up.  
2. **Cover & Water**  
   - Gently cover with soil.  
   - Water well.  
3. **Moisture**  
   - Keep soil moist (but not soggy) until shoots appear.

## 3. Growing & Care

### Watering  
- Check soil 5 cm below surface; water when dry.  
- Water **deeply** in early morning or late afternoon.  
- Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilising  
- **No extra fertiliser** needed if soil is well prepared.  
- For poorer soil or a boost:  
  - **High‑potassium** or flowering‑plant fertiliser.  
  - *Slow‑release:* apply at transplant or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
  - *Liquid:* apply during fruiting/flowering per label.

### Flowering  
- Expect blooms in **90–120 days**.  

### Cut Flowers  
- Use sharp snips or secateurs.  
- Cut the longest stems, remove lower leaves, place immediately in clean water.

### Post‑Flowering  
- Let foliage **die down naturally**; the bulb reabsorbs nutrients.  
- Once all leaves are gone, trim individual leaves at ground level with sharp tools.

### Long‑Term Care  
- Bulbs can stay in the ground for years; no need to lift and divide.  
- **Heavy mulch** protects from summer heat.  
- Lift bulbs in wet summers, overcrowded beds, or when relocating.

## 4. Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots/undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose. <br>• Use soap or alcohol spray. <br>• Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Rotten Bulbs/Corms** | Rot, no roots/shoots, stunted yellow leaves, no flowers. | • Plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers. <br>• Do not water while dormant. <br>• Lift and store if climate requires. |
| **Spider Mites** (Tetranychus urticae) | Dry, wilted, discolored leaves; undersides feel sandpaper‑like. | • Prune for better airflow. <br>• Spray eco‑oil or wettable sulphur. |
