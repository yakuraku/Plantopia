# How to Grow Honesty Seeds

**Family:** Brassicaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Lunaria annua_  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial (often grown as an annual)

## Preparation

Honesty plants are notorious for **self‑seeding**. At the end of the season they drop seeds that can germinate the next year.  
- **If you want them to thrive:** choose a sunny spot and let them spread.  
- **If you want to keep the garden tidy:** deadhead before seed drop or grow them in containers.

**Sunlight:** Full sun or part shade; aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.  
**Soil:** Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
1. Weed thoroughly.  
2. Loosen the soil by digging or turning.  
3. Add aged animal manure or compost.  
4. Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

## How to Sow Honesty Seeds

No special treatment (soaking, stratification) is needed.  
**Best practice:** raise seedlings in trays or containers first, then transplant.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a high‑quality seed‑raising mix (or use soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **3 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Keep soil **moist but not soggy**. |
| 4 | Germination takes **7–14 days** at **20–22 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **50 cm apart** when planting out. |

## How to Grow Honesty

### Watering

- Water when the top **5 cm** of soil feels dry (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- **Deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering is best.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal risk. *(Learn more about watering here.)*

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertilizer.

| Timing | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| At transplant or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall | **Slow‑release** fertilizer at the recommended rate. |
| While plants are fruiting or flowering | **Liquid** fertilizer at the recommended rate and frequency. |

### Growth & Flowering

- **Flowering time:** **85–95 days** after sowing.  
- **Seed pods (silicles):** Flat, round, green when young; dry to brown, then a light silvery tan.  
  - **Harvest seeds** by cutting pods when they turn brown but before they open.  
  - Remove seeds, spread on a paper towel, and dry in a warm, dry place.  
- **Cut flowers:** Wait until pods are fully dried, silvery, and papery.  
  - Cut stems at ground level with clean, sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - Use immediately or hang upside down in bunches for storage.

## Common Problems When Growing Honesty

| Problem | Description | Management |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides. They can wilt leaves, discolor them, and excrete honeydew that attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose to dislodge them.<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage natural predators (ladybirds, lacewings). *(Read more about aphids here.)* |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that munch on tender leaves, especially at night, leaving slimy trails. | • Remove hiding spots (rock piles, mulch).<br>• Keep free‑range poultry nearby.<br>• Spot‑collect at night or use traps. *(Read more about slugs and snails here.)* |
