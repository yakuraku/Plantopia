# How to Grow Potato Tubers

**Family:** Solanaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Solanum tuberosum_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

### Sunlight  
Potatoes love the sun. Pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of full sun** each day.

### Soil  
- Aim for a **loose, well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
- Weeding first, then dig to at least a spade’s depth to loosen the soil.  
- Mix in **aged animal manure or compost** to lighten heavy soils and give roots room to grow.  
- Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.

### Pests & Diseases  
- Potatoes are prone to pests and diseases.  
- **Crop rotation** is your best defense—never plant potatoes in the same spot two years in a row.  
- *Read more about crop rotation here.*  
- Only use **certified seed potatoes**; they’re disease‑free.

### Containers & Grow Bags  
- Potatoes can thrive in pots or grow bags.  
- Use a high‑quality potting mix and a **minimum of 40 L** container.  
- Container plants may need extra fertilizer during the season.

### Chitting (Optional)  
- Place seed potatoes in a single layer in a cool spot for a few weeks.  
- When sprouts reach **2–3 cm**, trim back to 2–3 strong shoots.  
- Plant immediately—chitting gives potatoes a head start and earlier harvest.

## Planting Seed Potatoes in the Garden

1. Dig **trenches 25 cm wide × 20 cm deep**; pile excess soil on the sides.  
2. Space trenches **60–75 cm apart**.  
3. Place potatoes **25–30 cm apart** in the trench and backfill with ~10 cm of soil.  
4. Water well.

## Growing Potatoes

### Watering  
- Water when the soil feels **dry 5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon watering is best.  
- Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilizing  
- If soil is already rich, skip extra fertilizer.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at transplant or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
  - **Liquid** fertilizer during fruiting/flowering, following the label’s rate and frequency.

### Mounding (for Indeterminate Varieties)  
- When shoots reach **15 cm**, add soil around stems, leaving top leaves exposed.  
- Keep adding soil or mulch as plants grow, aiming for **30–40 cm** above the original soil level or until the container is nearly full.  
- **Determinate varieties**: no mounding needed—just a 10 cm layer of organic mulch when shoots hit 15 cm.

### Frost Sensitivity  
- Potatoes are frost‑sensitive.  
- Plant **≈4 weeks before the last expected frost** in your region.

## Harvesting Potatoes

- **Timing:** 80–120 days after planting.  
- **Early/New Potatoes:** Harvest as soon as plants start to flower. Sample a few to check size; you can leave the rest to grow.  
- **Full‑Size Potatoes:** Wait until plants have flowered and foliage has fully died back (late summer/early autumn).  
  - Use a garden fork to gently lift tubers, shaking off soil.  
  - Or “bandicoot” by digging a few tubers at a time.  
- **Storage:** Keep in a dark, cool, well‑ventilated space. Check regularly for rot or sprouting.  
- **Safety:** Do not eat tubers with green skin or shoots—they may contain toxins.

## Common Problems When Growing Potatoes

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Onion Thrips** (_Thrips tabaci_) | Tiny (≤1.5 mm) pale yellow to light brown; silver patches on leaves; reduced yield. | Wash with a hose, mulch around plants, encourage predatory mites and lacewings via companion planting. |
| **Early Blight** (Target Spot) | Circular brown/black spots (~6 mm) on leaves and stems; reduces productivity. | Use certified seed potatoes, apply fungicide to affected plants, practice crop rotation. |
| **Potato Scab** | Rough, raised patches or brown depressions on tuber skin; caused by bacteria or fungi. | Grow certified seed, choose resistant varieties, maintain crop rotation, avoid inconsistent watering and alkaline soils. |
| **Rotten Tubers** | Tubers rot after sitting in cold, wet soil or waterlogged conditions; no roots/shoots or stunted yellow leaves. | Plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers; do not water until shoots appear; lift and store tubers over winter if needed. |
| **Bacterial Wilt** | Wilting, yellowing, stunting, die‑back; brown‑grey patches on tuber skin, oozing from eyes. | Use certified seed, dispose of infected plants in general waste, rotate crops. |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insects on leaf undersides; yellowing leaves, wilting, slowed growth. | Hose spray or soap spray; remove heavily infested plants; attract beneficial predators. |
