## 1. Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Choose a spot that gets **at least 6 h of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly **weed** the area, then **dig over** to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
- *Tip:* A healthy, loamy base means fewer problems later on.

## 2. How to Sow Gourd Seeds

| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **1. Direct sow** | Drop seeds **20 mm deep** and **100–150 cm apart**. Rows should be **200 cm apart**. |
| **2. Moisture** | Keep the soil **moist but never soggy**. |
| **3. Germination** | Seeds sprout in **7–14 days** when the soil is **24–35 °C**. |
| **4. Protection** | Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

> **Remember:** Gourds are frost‑sensitive. **Never transplant or sow outdoors** until the danger of frost has passed.

## 3. Growing the Plant

### Watering

- **When to water:** Test the soil 5 cm below the surface with your finger. If it feels dry, it’s time to water.  
- **How to water:** Apply **deep, even water** in the **early morning** or **late afternoon**.  
- **Avoid leaf wetting** to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilizing

- **No extra fertilizer** needed if the soil was well prepared.  
- **Boosting the soil:**  
  - *Slow‑release* fertilizer at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - *Liquid* fertilizer at the recommended rate and frequency during **fruiting or flowering**.

### Support & Spacing

- **Ground growth:** Allocate **≥ 2 m² per plant**.  
- **Trellis growth:** Gourds will climb using tendrils.  
  - Provide a sturdy trellis and gently tie vines with twine or plant ties.  
  - **Set up support before sowing** to avoid disturbing roots later.

### Mulching

- **Under ripening fruit:** Use **straw** or **sugar cane** mulch to keep the fruit dry and prevent rot.

## 4. Harvesting Gourds

| Purpose | When to Harvest | How |
|---------|-----------------|-----|
| **Vegetable** | Skin glossy, fruit large enough to eat. | Cut from the vine, leaving a small stem. |
| **Ornamental** | Stems become tough/woody or leaves dry/brown. | Cut with **5–10 cm** of stem attached. |

### Curing (Ornamental)

1. **Cure for a week** in a single layer, airy spot, away from direct sun and frost.  
2. Store in a **dark, dry** place at **10–16 °C**.  
3. **Rotate** regularly and discard any that show rot.  
4. Once fully dry, gourds can serve as **table décor, musical instruments, vessels, or craft material**.

## 5. Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | What Happens | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small sap‑suckers (2–4 mm) on new shoots/undersides; cause wilting, discoloration, honeydew. | Spray with a garden hose, soap/alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Blossom End Rot** | Dark, hard discoloration from the bottom due to calcium deficiency and inconsistent watering. | Dispose of affected fruit, water regularly and evenly, correct soil pH and nutrients. |
| **Not Setting Fruit** | Lack of pollination leads to flower drop or shriveling fruit. | Wait for both male and female flowers; use a paintbrush to transfer pollen. |
| **Animals (Possums, Birds, etc.)** | Can destroy a large portion of the harvest overnight. | Use netting or cages; try homemade sprays (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; reduces yield. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide or homemade spray. |

> *Pro tip:* Regular scouting and early intervention keep your gourds healthy and productive.
