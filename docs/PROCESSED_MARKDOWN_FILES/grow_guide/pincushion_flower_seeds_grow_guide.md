---

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Pincushion flowers thrive in **full sun** – aim for at least **6 h of direct light** each day.  
- **Perennial care:** If you’re growing a perennial variety, pick a **permanent spot** that won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Self‑seeding:** These plants often drop seeds at season’s end.  
  - *Want them to spread?* Leave the area open.  
  - *Prefer to keep them out?* Deadhead before seed drop or grow in containers.  
- **Soil:** Needs **well‑drained, organic‑rich** soil.  
  1. Weed thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  3. Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  4. Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a variety suited for pots.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Minimum pot size: **10 L**.  
  - Container plants may need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Pincushion Flower Seeds

No pre‑treatment (soaking, stratification) is required.  
You can **direct‑sow** in the garden or **raise seedlings** in trays and transplant later.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep** and **25 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist**—never water‑logged or dry. |
| 3 | Germination: **10–12 days** at **18–21 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist** soil—avoid both wet and dry extremes. |
| 4 | Germination: **10–12 days** at **18–21 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space transplanted plants **25 cm apart**. |

## How to Grow Pincushion Flowers

### Watering

- Check soil moisture **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the **early morning** or **late afternoon**.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertiliser.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertiliser:  
  - **Slow‑release**: apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - **Liquid**: apply during flowering or fruiting, following the product’s rate and frequency.

### Flowering & Deadheading

- Pincushion flowers bloom in **~190 days**.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading or dead flowers **just above a leaf set** with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - This encourages more blooms.  
- For **cut flowers**:  
  - Cut the **longest stems** with sharp tools.  
  - Remove lower leaves and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.

### Perennial Care

- After flowering, **prune back** to tidy the plant and stimulate strong new growth.  
- Cut stems **just above a set of lower leaves** with sharp secateurs or snips.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap/alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Night‑time feeding on tender leaves; slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep poultry, use traps, or torchlight collection. |
| **Spider Mites** | Dry, wilted, or discolored leaves; fine sandpaper feel on undersides. | Prune for airflow, spray eco‑oil or wettable sulphur. |
| **Thrips** | Tiny flying insects; larvae leave small white/transparent marks on leaves and petals. | Wash with a hose, encourage predatory mites/lacewings, spray soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |
