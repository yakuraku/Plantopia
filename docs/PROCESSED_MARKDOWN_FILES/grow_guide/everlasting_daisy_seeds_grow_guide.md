# How to Grow Everlasting Daisy Seeds

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Xerochrysum bracteatum_  
**Life Cycle:** Short‑lived Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot** – Everlasting daisies are perennials, so pick a location that won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Full sun is a must** – Aim for at least **6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Well‑drained soil** – These plants thrive in dry, sandy or loamy soil.  
  - No need for manure or extra fertilisers in most cases.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area and loosen the soil with a spade or tiller.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Container growing** – If you’re growing in pots, pick a variety suited to containers.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Containers should be **at least 20 L** to accommodate mature plants.  
  - During the growing season, container plants may need a little extra fertiliser to stay healthy.  

## How to Sow Everlasting Daisy Seeds

Everlasting daisy seeds are easy to handle—no soaking or stratification required. Light exposure can boost germination, so press the seeds onto damp soil and lightly cover them with fine soil.

You can sow directly in the garden or start seedlings in trays and transplant later.

### Sow Direct

1. **Plant 1 mm deep** and space **40–60 cm** apart.  
2. Keep the soil **moist but never soggy or dry**.  
3. Germination takes **7–14 days** at **18–21 °C**.  
4. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  

### Raise Seedlings

1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good quality seed‑raising mix (or soil starter pellets).  
2. Sow seeds **1 mm deep**.  
3. Maintain **moist but not waterlogged** soil.  
4. Germination: **7–14 days** at **18–21 °C**.  
5. Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. Space plants **40–60 cm** apart in the garden.  

**Tip:** The “scatter seed” method works well too. Roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly smooth over to cover them.

## How to Grow Everlasting Daisy

- **Drought tolerant** – Once established, these plants thrive in dry, well‑drained soil.  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings.  
  - Water only when the top **10 cm** feels dry (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  
- **Low nutrient needs** – They grow well in nutrient‑poor soils and usually don’t need extra fertiliser during the season.  
- **Flowering time** – Expect blooms in **80–90 days**.  
- **Cut flowers** – Use sharp snips or secateurs to cut the longest stems, remove lower leaves, and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.  
  - *Learn more about cutting and conditioning homegrown flowers here.*  
- **Deadheading** – Regularly trim fading or dead flowers just above a set of leaves to encourage more blooms.

- **Post‑flower pruning** – After flowering, prune back to tidy the plant and stimulate strong new growth.  
  - Cut individual stems just above a lower leaf set with sharp tools.  

## Common Problems When Growing Everlasting Daisies

Like all plants, everlasting daisies can run into a few trouble spots. Below are the most common issues and how to tackle them.

### Aphids

- Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects that cluster on new shoots or leaf undersides.  
- Symptoms: Wilted or discoloured leaves, honeydew that attracts ants.  
- **Control tips:**  
  - Spray with a garden hose to dislodge them.  
  - Use a soap or alcohol spray.  
  - Encourage natural predators (ladybirds, lacewings).

### Powdery Mildew

- Fungal spores that appear as white spots and can spread across leaves.  
- Not usually fatal but can reduce yields.  
- **Prevention & treatment:**  
  - Water at soil level, not on leaves.  
  - Ensure good airflow between plants.  
  - Remove affected leaves.  
  - If needed, spray with a suitable fungicide or a homemade remedy.  
  - *Read more about powdery mildew here.*  

### Slugs & Snails

- Molluscs that munch on tender leaves and shoots, especially at night, leaving slimy trails.  
- **Control methods:**  
  - Remove hiding places (rock piles, mulch).  
  - Keep free‑range poultry to help.  
  - Spot‑collect by torchlight or use traps.
