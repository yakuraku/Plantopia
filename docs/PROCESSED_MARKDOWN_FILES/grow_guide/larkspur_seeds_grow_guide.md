## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Larkspur thrives in **full sun to part shade**. Pick a spot that gets *at least 3 hours of direct sun* each day.  
- **Self‑seeding:** These plants often drop seed at season’s end. If you *don’t want them to spread*, deadhead before seed set or grow in containers.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen (dig over), and amend with **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

## How to Sow Larkspur Seeds

1. **Optional Stratification** – Expose seeds to a cold period to break dormancy and boost germination. *Read more about stratification here.*  
2. **Direct Sowing** –  
   - Plant **3 mm deep** and **20 cm apart**.  
   - Keep soil **moist but never soggy or dry**.  
   - Germination takes **14–21 days** at **12–18 °C**.  
   - Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until established.

## How to Grow Larkspur

### Watering  
- Water when the soil feels dry **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Aim for **deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering.  
- Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk. *Learn more about watering here.*

### Fertilizing  
- **No extra fertilizer** needed if soil is well prepared.  
- For poorer soil or a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - **Liquid** fertilizer at the recommended rate/frequency during flowering or fruiting.

### Support  
- As plants grow, use a **stake, bamboo cane, trellis, or string lines**.  
- Install support **before sowing or transplanting** to avoid root disturbance.

### Flowering Time  
- Expect blooms in **130–150 days**.

### Cut Flowers  
- Use **sharp snips or secateurs** to cut the longest stems, remove lower leaves, and place immediately in a clean bucket of water. *Learn more about cutting and conditioning homegrown flowers here.*

### Deadheading  
- Regularly trim fading or dead flowers just above a set of leaves with sharp tools.  
- This encourages **more blooms**. *Learn more about deadheading flowering plants here.*

## Common Problems When Growing Larkspur

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew attracting ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; reduces yield but rarely fatal. | Water at soil level (not on leaves), improve airflow, remove affected leaves, and apply suitable fungicide or homemade spray. *Read more about powdery mildew here.* |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves at night, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, spot‑collect at night, or set traps. *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
