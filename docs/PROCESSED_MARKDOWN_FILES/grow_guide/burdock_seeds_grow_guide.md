# How to Grow Burdock Seeds

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Arctium lappa_  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Burdock loves **full sun** or **partial shade**. Aim for at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Root depth:** Roots can reach **1 m or more**, so you need a **deep, loose, well‑drained** soil.  
- **Soil enrichment:**  
  - Thoroughly weed the area.  
  - Dig deeply to loosen the soil.  
  - Add **aged animal manure** or **rich compost**.  
  - In heavy soils, incorporate organic matter to lighten the texture and give roots room to grow.  
- **Weed control:** Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  

**Tip:** Burdock often **self‑seeds**. If you don’t want it spreading, deadhead plants before seed drop or grow them in containers.

## How to Sow Burdock Seeds

> *Optional:* Soaking seeds in water can soften hard coats, break dormancy, and speed up germination. Learn more about soaking seeds [here](#).

1. **Direct sow**:  
   - Plant seeds **15 mm deep**.  
   - Space each seed **15 cm apart** in rows **60 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
3. **Germination:**  
   - Expect **7–14 days** for seedlings to appear.  
   - Ideal soil temperature: **20–25 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

## How to Grow Burdock

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil moisture **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
  - Learn more about watering [here](#).  
- **Thinning:** When seedlings are sturdy, thin them to **15 cm spacing** by pulling out weaker ones.  
- **Fertilizer:** Burdock thrives in **nutrient‑poor soils** and usually **doesn’t need extra fertilizer** during the growing season.

## How to Harvest Burdock

- **Timing:** Roots are ready in about **120 days**.  
- **Size:** Aim for roots **50–60 cm long**—large enough to eat but still tender.  
- **Method:**  
  1. Use a garden fork to lift the root (pulling by leaves can break it).  
  2. Shake off excess soil.  
  3. Cut the foliage **1–2 cm above** the root.  
- **Storage:** Keep in a **perforated plastic bag** in the fridge for short‑term use.

## Common Problems When Growing Burdock

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Aphids** | Small sap‑suckers (2–4 mm) on new shoots or leaf undersides. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap/alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Forked roots** | Stony or heavy clay soils that restrict root growth. | Cultivate well before planting; add coarse sand or compost to lighten soil; choose round or short varieties for heavy soils. |
| **Small roots** | Over‑sowing or excessive fertilization. | Thin seedlings to give roots space; avoid fertilizing to prevent foliage overgrowth. |
| **Split roots** | Inconsistent watering during maturity. | Water deeply and evenly; consider recent or expected rainfall before watering. |
| **Tough roots** | Harvested too late. | Harvest when roots are young and tender. |
