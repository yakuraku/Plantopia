# How to Grow Impatiens Seeds

**Family:** Balsaminaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Impatiens balsamina_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Impatiens thrive in **full sun or part shade**. Aim for **at least 3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:** Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area.  
  - Dig over to loosen the soil.  
  - Add **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a variety labeled for container growing.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Pick a pot that holds **at least 10 L** (≈2.6 gal).  
  - Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the season.

## How to Sow Impatiens Seeds

Impatiens seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking, stratification, or scarification required.

1. **Seed‑raising mix**  
   - Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sowing depth**  
   - Plant seeds **6 mm (¼ in)** deep.  
3. **Moisture**  
   - Keep the soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
4. **Germination**  
   - Expect **14–21 days** at a soil temperature of **22–26 °C (72–79 °F)**.  
5. **Transplanting**  
   - Move seedlings outdoors once they develop their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
   - Space plants **30–40 cm (12–16 in)** apart.  
6. **Frost caution**  
   - Impatiens are frost‑sensitive. **Never transplant or sow outdoors** until the danger of frost has passed.  
   - *Optional:* In cooler climates, start indoors **6 weeks before the last expected frost** in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Impatiens

- **Watering**  
  - Keep soil **evenly moist**—never let it dry out or become waterlogged.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the foliage to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- **Fertilising**  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra fertiliser.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertiliser:  
    - **Slow‑release**: apply at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid**: apply during flowering or fruiting at the recommended rate/frequency.  
- **Flowering**  
  - Expect blooms in **80–95 days**.  
- **Deadheading**  
  - Regularly trim faded or dead flowers just above a set of leaves with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - This encourages continuous blooming.

## Common Problems When Growing Impatiens

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | - Spray with a garden hose.<br>- Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>- Encourage natural predators. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scab‑like patches; leaves and flowers may drop early. | - Water at soil level, not on leaves.<br>- Remove fallen leaves and fruit.<br>- Practice crop rotation. |
| **Grey Mould (Botrytis)** | Mouldy flowers and rotting fruit; spores spread by wind, survive in soil or green waste. | - Prune affected flowers/fruit.<br>- Water at soil level.<br>- Apply fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Damping Off** | Seeds fail to germinate or seedlings rot at the base, becoming soft and mushy. | - Use fresh potting mix.<br>- Avoid overwatering foliage.<br>- Keep soil from becoming waterlogged. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow to grey‑brown patches on leaf undersides. | - Water at soil level.<br>- Remove and destroy affected leaves.<br>- Ensure good airflow; avoid overcrowding.<br>- Use homemade milk spray or fungicide if persistent. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that chew tender leaves at night, leaving slimy trails. | - Remove hiding places.<br>- Keep free‑range poultry.<br>- Use torchlight to spot and trap them.<br>- Place traps or use natural deterrents. |

> **Tip:** Keep a close eye on your plants—early detection and quick action are key to keeping impatiens healthy and blooming beautifully.
