# How to Grow Garlic Bulbs  

**Family:** Amaryllidaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Allium sativum_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Garlic loves *full sun* – aim for at least **6 hours a day**.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Loose, well‑drained, enriched with organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, dig to at least a spade’s depth, then mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - In heavy soils, adding organic matter lightens the ground and frees root growth.  
- **Drainage:** If drainage is uncertain, mound the soil into rows or use raised beds.  
- **Weed control:** Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

## How to Plant Garlic  

Garlic cloves thrive when planted *directly* into the garden.  

1. **Separate** the bulb into individual cloves.  
   - *Skip* very small cloves – they’re usually edible.  
2. **Dig holes** 3–5 cm deep, spaced **10–15 cm apart**.  
   - Rows should be **20 cm apart**.  
3. **Plant** one clove per hole:  
   - Thick end down, pointed end up.  
4. **Cover** with soil and **water well**.  
5. **Mulch** with straw, lucerne, or another organic mulch.  
6. **Shoots** should appear in **2–6 weeks**.

## How to Grow Garlic  

- **Watering:**  
  - Check the soil 5 cm below the surface; water when it feels dry.  
  - Water *deeply* in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is well‑prepared, skip extra fertilizer.  
  - Over‑fertilizing (especially high nitrogen) can stunt bulb growth.  
  - In poor soil, use a low‑nitrogen, high‑phosphorus fertilizer (e.g., blood and bone) at the recommended rate.  
- **Hardneck varieties:**  
  - Remove scapes (flower stalks) at the base when they start curling to encourage bulb formation.

## How to Harvest Garlic  

- **Timing:** Garlic is ready in **200–300 days**.  
- **Signs of readiness:**  
  - Foliage wilts and turns yellow.  
  - 4–6 green leaves remain.  
- **Method:**  
  1. Use a fork to gently lift the plant.  
  2. Shake off excess soil.  
  3. Harvest one plant first to confirm bulb formation.  
  4. If the bulb is small or missing, wait 2–3 weeks and re‑check.  
- **Curing:**  
  - Place whole plants on wire racks or hang in bunches.  
  - Keep in a dry, cool spot for **3–10 weeks**.  
  - Softneck garlic can be braided after curing.  
  - Trim roots and stems to **2.5 cm** and store in a cool, dry place for up to **10 months**.

## Common Problems When Growing Garlic  

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Bulbs Not Forming** | Harvested too early, inconsistent watering, small cloves, or excess nitrogen. | Plant climate‑suitable varieties, avoid over‑fertilizing, water consistently, harvest after leaf senescence. |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._) | Brown to orange raised spots or patches on foliage; spreads in 10–20 °C, high humidity. | Space plants to avoid overcrowding, provide full sun, avoid over‑fertilizing, remove dead plants, rotate crops. |
| **Onion Thrips** (_Thrips tabaci_) | Silver patches on leaves; sap‑sucking damage. | Wash with a garden hose, mulch around plants, encourage predatory mites and lacewings via companion planting. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; reduces yield. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, apply suitable fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Rotten Bulbs/Corms** | Bulbs show rot, no roots or shoots, stunted yellow leaves. | Grow in free‑draining soil, raised beds or containers; avoid waterlogging; store properly if needed. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Tender leaves and shoots eaten at night, slimy trails. | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, use traps, or torchlight collection. |
