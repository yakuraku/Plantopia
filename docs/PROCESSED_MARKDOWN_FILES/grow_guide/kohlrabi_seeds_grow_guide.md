## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Kohlrabi loves **full sun** or **partial shade**. Pick a spot that gets at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs **well‑drained** loam rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, dig to loosen, then mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Tip:* For more on soil prep, check out our guide on preparing soil for planting.
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, choose a variety labeled **“container‑friendly.”**  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot of at least **40 L** (about 10 gal).  
  - Container plants often need extra fertilizer to stay healthy.

## How to Sow Kohlrabi Seeds

Kohlrabi seeds are simple to handle—no soaking or stratification required.

1. **Direct sow** in the garden:  
   - Plant **5 mm deep** and **10–20 cm apart**.  
   - Space rows **30–40 cm** apart.
2. **Moisture:** Keep the soil **moist but never soggy**.  
3. **Germination:** Seeds sprout in **3–10 days** when the soil is **16–27 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

## Growing Kohlrabi

### Watering

- Water when the soil feels **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil).  
- Aim for **deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering.  
- **Avoid wetting the leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
- If the soil is poor or you want a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release fertilizer** at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm** tall.  
  - **Liquid fertilizer** at the recommended rate/frequency during fruiting or flowering.

## Harvesting Kohlrabi

- **Timing:** Ready to harvest in **55–70 days** after sowing.
- **Leaves:**  
  - Harvest when large enough to eat.  
  - Pinch off outer leaves, leaving some for regrowth.  
  - Consume or store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge; use promptly.
- **Stems (bulbs):**  
  - Cut just above ground level, leaving **1–2 cm** of foliage.  
  - Store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - For longer storage, **pickle** or **blanch & freeze**.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | What Happens | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Cabbage moth / cabbage white butterfly** | Eggs on leaf undersides → caterpillars chew holes, skeletonize leaves. | Use netting or decoys; hand‑pick caterpillars; targeted sprays. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Night‑time munching, slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep poultry, use traps or torchlight collection. |
| **Aphids** | Small sap‑suckers on new shoots/undersides → wilting, honeydew, ant attraction. | Spray with water, soap/alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering → seed production. | Avoid sowing before frost danger; keep plants well‑watered in heat. |
| **Tough stems** | Slow growth, heat or water stress → hard stems. | Provide ample water & nutrients; avoid extreme heat/cold; harvest early. |
| **Stem not swollen** | Over‑thick sowing, slow growth, stress. | Thin seedlings for space; ensure proper water & nutrients; avoid extreme temperatures. |
