# How to Grow Billy Buttons Seeds

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Pycnosorus globosus_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

Billy buttons are *perennial*, so choose a **permanent spot** where the plants can stay undisturbed.  
- **Sunlight:** Full sun or part shade; aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:** Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  1. Weed thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  3. Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  4. Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

## How to Sow Billy Buttons Seeds

Billy buttons seeds are **easy to handle**—no soaking or stratification needed.  
You can **direct‑sow** or **raise seedlings** first.

### Direct Sowing

1. **Plant** seeds **1 mm deep** and **40 cm apart**.  
2. Keep the soil **moist but never soggy or dry**.  
3. Germination takes **14–21 days** at **21–24 °C**.  
4. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raising Seedlings

1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **high‑quality seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets).  
2. Sow seeds **1 mm deep**.  
3. Maintain **moist but not waterlogged** soil.  
4. Germination: **14–21 days** at **21–24 °C**.  
5. **Transplant** when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. Space plants **40 cm apart** in the garden.

> **Tip:** For a quick start, try the *scatter seed* method—roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly smooth over.

> **Optional:** In cooler climates, start indoors **6 weeks before the last frost**. Keep them in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Billy Buttons

### Watering

- Water when the soil feels **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil).  
- **Deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering is best.  
- Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilizing

- If the soil is well‑prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is needed.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **low‑phosphorus** or **native‑plant** fertilizer:  
  - **Slow‑release**: apply at transplanting or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
  - **Liquid**: apply during fruiting or flowering, following the recommended rate and frequency.

> **Optional:** Thin seedlings when they’re large enough to handle—pull out weak ones so plants stay **40 cm apart**.

### Flowering

- Billy buttons typically **flower in 90–100 days**.  
- For cut flowers: use sharp snips or secateurs to cut the **longest stems**, remove lower leaves, and place stems in a clean bucket of water.

- **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading or dead flowers just above a set of leaves with sharp tools. This encourages more blooms.

- After flowering, **prune** back to tidy the plant and stimulate strong new growth. Cut stems just above a set of lower leaves.

- In cold weather, plants may die back. Cut them back **just above ground level** in late autumn, or prune off dead foliage when new leaves appear in spring.

## Common Problems When Growing Billy Buttons

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Slugs & Snails** | Tender leaves and shoots eaten, slimy trails, especially at night. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, spot‑check by torchlight, use traps. |
| **Spider Mites** (Tetranychus urticae) | Dry, wilted, or discoloured leaves; undersides feel sandpapery. | Improve air flow by pruning, spray eco‑oil or wettable sulphur. |
