## Preparation

Forget‑me‑not plants are *self‑seeding*—they drop seeds onto the soil at the end of the season that can germinate the next year.  
- **Choose a welcoming spot**: If you want the plants to thrive, pick a location that will receive at least **3 hours of full sun** each day.  
- **Control unwanted spread**: If you prefer to keep them out of the garden, *deadhead* the flowers before they set seed or grow the plants in containers.  

### Soil & Site

- **Well‑drained, organic‑rich soil** is essential.  
  1. Weed the area thoroughly.  
  2. Dig over to loosen the soil.  
  3. Add aged animal manure or compost.  
- Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- For container growing, use a **minimum of 10 L** pot and a good quality potting mix.  
- Container plants may need extra fertiliser during the growing season to stay healthy.

## How to Sow Forget Me Not Seeds

Forget‑me‑not seeds need **no pre‑treatment** (no soaking or stratification).

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **1** | Sow seeds **5 mm** deep, **30 cm** apart. |
| **2** | Keep soil **moist**—never water‑logged or dry. |
| **3** | Germination takes **10–14 days** at **18–22 °C**. |
| **4** | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **1** | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets. |
| **2** | Sow seeds **5 mm** deep. |
| **3** | Keep soil **moist**—never water‑logged or dry. |
| **4** | Germination: **10–14 days** at **18–22 °C**. |
| **5** | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm** tall. |
| **6** | Space plants **30 cm** apart in the garden. |

**Tip:** For a quick, informal approach, try the *scatter seed* method: roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly smooth over to cover.

## How to Grow Forget Me Not

### Watering

- Water when the soil is **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
- **Deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering is best.  
- **Avoid wetting the leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising

- If the soil is well‑prepared, **no extra fertiliser** is needed.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertiliser:  
  - *Slow‑release*: apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - *Liquid*: apply at the recommended rate while plants are flowering.

### Thinning

- Once seedlings are large enough to handle, thin them to give each plant room to grow.  
- Pull out any weak or small seedlings so spacing is **≈30 cm**.

### Flowering

- Forget‑me‑not plants typically flower in **160–350 days**.

### Deadheading

- Regularly remove faded or dead flowers with sharp secateurs or snips, cutting just above a set of leaves.  
- This encourages continuous blooming.

### Cutting for Flowers

- For cut flowers, snip the longest stems possible, remove lower leaves, and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention / Remedy |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides | Water at soil level (not on leaves), remove & destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding, consider homemade milk spray or fungicide if persistent. |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves | Water at soil level, ensure good airflow, remove affected leaves, use appropriate fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Slimy trails, tender leaf damage, mainly at night | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, use traps or torchlight collection, consider natural deterrents. |
