# How to Grow Roman Lawn Chamomile Seeds

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Chamaemelum nobile_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

### Pick the Perfect Spot  
- **Sunlight:** Roman lawn chamomile loves **full sun to part shade**. Aim for at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Perennial Placement:** Because it’s a **perennial**, choose a **permanent location** where the plants can stay undisturbed.  
- **Self‑seeding Friendly:** The plant will **self‑seed** each season. If you want it to spread, plant in an area where new seedlings are welcome. If you prefer to keep it contained, **deadhead** before seed drop or grow in containers.

### Soil & Bed Prep  
- **Well‑drained, organic‑rich soil** is key.  
- **Weed removal:** Thoroughly weed the bed.  
- **Loosen the soil:** Dig or till to break up compacted layers.  
- **Add organic matter:** Mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
- **Keep weed‑free** until planting to give your chamomile a head start.

### Container Growing  
- **Pot size:** Minimum **10 L** for mature plants.  
- **Potting mix:** Use a high‑quality, well‑draining mix.  
- **Fertiliser:** Container plants may need extra feeding to stay healthy.

## How to Sow Roman Lawn Chamomile Seeds

### No Pretreatment Needed  
- Seeds can be sown **directly** without soaking or stratification.

### Direct Sowing Method  
1. **Depth & Spacing:** Sow **1 mm deep** and **20 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil **moist but not waterlogged**.  
3. **Germination:** Expect **7–14 days** at **12–25 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Scatter‑Seed Alternative  
- Roughen the soil, **scatter seeds evenly**, then lightly rake over to cover.  
- Ideal for a more informal look.

### Tips for Tiny Seeds  
- Handle with care to prevent loss to wind or water.  
- Mix seeds with sand or fine potting mix before sowing.  
- Use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly.  
- Press lightly into the surface for good seed‑soil contact.  
- Keep seeds and seedlings from drying out.

### Watering  
- **Check moisture** 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit of soil).  
- **When dry, water deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid leaf wetness** to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising  
- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertiliser.  
- **Boosting options:**  
  * **High‑potassium** or **flowering‑plant** fertiliser.  
  * **Slow‑release**: apply at transplant or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
  * **Liquid**: apply at the recommended rate during fruiting or flowering.

### Growth & Flowering  
- **Flowering time:** Roughly **230 days** from sowing.  
- **Harvesting:** Pick flowers when fully open. Pinch the stem just below the head; no stem attached.  
- **Fresh or dried:**  
  * **Drying:** Spread in a single layer on a wire rack or paper towels. Keep in a dry, warm spot out of direct sunlight for 1–2 weeks.  
  * **Storage:** Seal dried flowers in a glass jar for up to **six months**.  
- **Pruning (optional):** After flowering, trim back to tidy the plant and encourage vigorous new growth. Use sharp secateurs or snips to cut stems just above a set of lower leaves.

## Common Problems When Growing Roman Lawn Chamomile

| Pest / Disease | What It Looks Like | Why It Matters | Quick Fix |
|----------------|--------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may leave honeydew attracting ants. | Can wilt leaves, discolor, and spread honeydew. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap/alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves. | Reduces yield; rarely fatal. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, and apply fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves at night, leaving slimy trails. | Damage foliage. | Remove hiding spots, use free‑range poultry, collect by torchlight, or set traps. |
| **Thrips** | Tiny black/beige/white insects (<1.5 mm) with larvae that leave small white or transparent marks. | Affects flower and leaf appearance; can transmit pathogens. | Wash with a garden hose, encourage predatory mites/lacewings, or spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |
