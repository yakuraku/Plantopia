## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot**: Borage can become a stubborn weed once established. Pick a dedicated garden bed or grow in containers to keep it from spreading.
- **Self‑seeding alert**: Borage drops seeds at season’s end that can germinate next year. If you don’t want it to take over, **deadhead** before seed drop or keep it in pots.
- **Sunlight**: Full sun to part shade works best. Aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** daily.
- **Soil**: Needs well‑drained, organic‑rich soil.  
  1. Weed thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen with a fork or tiller.  
  3. Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  4. Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
  *(Learn more about soil prep here.)*
- **Container growing**:  
  - Pick a variety suited for pots.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Minimum **10 L** pot for mature plants.  
  - Containers may need extra fertiliser during the season.

## How to Sow Borage Seeds

Borage seeds are *easy*—no soaking or stratification required.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow 10 mm deep, 30 cm apart. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but not soggy**. |
| 3 | Germination: 5–10 days at 20–22 °C. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow 10 mm deep. |
| 3 | Maintain moist soil (never wet or dry). |
| 4 | Germinate in 5–10 days at 20–22 °C. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are 5–10 cm tall. |
| 6 | Space plants 30 cm apart in the garden. |

**Tip**: For a quick scatter‑seed method, roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil.

## How to Grow Borage

- **Watering**:  
  - Check soil 5 cm below surface (scratch a bit).  
  - Water deeply in early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk. *(More on watering here.)*
- **Thinning**: Once seedlings are sturdy, pull out weaker ones to give each plant ~30 cm of space.
- **Fertiliser**: Borage thrives in nutrient‑poor soil; no extra fertiliser needed during the season.
- **Maturity**: Expect harvest in **80–90 days**.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves | • Water at soil level, not on foliage.<br>• Ensure good airflow.<br>• Remove affected leaves.<br>• Use fungicide or homemade spray if needed. *(Read more here.)* |
| **Slugs & snails** | Slimy trails, especially at night | • Remove hiding spots.<br>• Keep free‑range poultry.<br>• Spot‑check at night or use traps. *(Read more here.)* |
| **Whitefly** | Yellowing or wilting leaves; clouds of insects on undersides | • Rinse with a garden hose or soap spray.<br>• Destroy severely affected plants.<br>• Encourage beneficial insects that prey on whitefly. *(Read more here.)* |
