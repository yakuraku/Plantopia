# How to Grow Petunia Seeds

**Family:** Solanaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Petunia x hybrida_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Petunias love *full sun* – aim for at least **6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a *well‑drained* mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, dig it over to loosen, then add **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the spot weed‑free until you plant.  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, pick a variety rated for container use.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and choose a pot that holds **at least 10 L** for mature plants.  
  - Remember: container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Petunia Seeds

Petunia seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification required.

1. **Choose a growing medium**  
   - Seed‑raising mix, soil starter pellets, or jiffy pots.  
2. **Sow**  
   - Plant seeds **3 mm deep**.  
3. **Moisture**  
   - Keep soil *moist* but never *wet* or *dry*.  
4. **Germination**  
   - Expect 5–15 days at **21–28 °C**.  
5. **Transplant**  
   - Move seedlings outdoors once they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing**  
   - Plant at **30 cm** intervals.

> **Tip:** Petunias are *half‑hardy*. Mature plants can handle light frosts, but seedlings need protection until they’re established. **Never plant outside until the danger of frost has passed.**

### Scatter‑Seed Method

If you prefer a quick start:
- Roughen the soil surface.  
- Scatter seeds evenly.  
- Lightly smooth over to cover.  
- Press gently to ensure good soil contact.

### Handling Tiny Seeds

- Mix seeds with a little sand or fine potting mix to keep them from blowing away.  
- Use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly.  
- After sowing, press lightly into the soil and keep them from drying out.

> **Optional:** In cooler climates, start seeds indoors **6 weeks** before the last expected frost. Keep them in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Petunia

### Watering

- Water when the top **5 cm** of soil feels dry (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Aim for **deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering.  
- Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilising

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra feed.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertiliser:  
  - **Slow‑release:** Apply at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - **Liquid:** Apply during flowering or fruiting, following the label’s rate and frequency.

### Flowering & Maintenance

- Petunias typically bloom in **80–100 days**.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading or dead flowers just above a leaf set with sharp secateurs or snips.  
- After the main bloom period, **prune** back to tidy the plant and encourage vigorous new growth. Cut stems just above a lower leaf set.

## Common Problems When Growing Petunias

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Grey mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Mouldy flowers, rotting fruit; spores spread by wind. | Prune affected parts, water at soil level, consider a fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Damping off** | Seeds fail to germinate or seedlings rot at the base. | Use fresh potting mix, avoid watering foliage, keep soil from becoming waterlogged. |
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level, remove and destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding, consider a homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Slimy trails, tender leaf damage, mainly at night. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use traps, or collect by torchlight. |
