## 🌞 Where to Plant – Light & Location

- **Sun exposure:** Aim for **at least 3 hours of full sun** each day.  
- **Shade strategy:** Freesias thrive under deciduous trees—dappled shade in summer, full sun in winter.  
- **Permanent spot:** Once established, they’re hard to eradicate. Pick a **fixed garden bed** or grow in **containers** to keep them from spreading.

## 🌱 Soil Prep – The Foundation for Beautiful Blooms

1. **Choose the right soil:** Loose, well‑drained, enriched with organic matter.  
2. **Weed out** everything and dig to at least a **spade’s depth**.  
3. **Add** aged animal manure or compost to lighten heavy soils and boost fertility.  
4. **Keep weed‑free** until planting.  
5. **Container tip:** Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot of **≥10 L** for mature plants.  
6. **Extra fertiliser?** Not usually needed if soil is well prepared, but container plants may benefit from a little extra.

## 🪤 How to Plant Freesia Bulbs

- **Plant in place**—no transplanting later.  
- **Spacing:** 5 cm apart, 5 cm deep.  
- **Orientation:** Pointed tip up.  
- **Cover & water** gently.  
- **Moisture:** Keep soil moist (but not soggy) until shoots appear.

## 💧 Watering – When and How

- **Check dryness:** Feel 5 cm below the surface; if dry, water.  
- **Best times:** Early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid leaf wetness** to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Container care:** May need more frequent watering.

## 🌿 Fertilising – Boosting Flower Production

- **If soil is poor** or you want a stronger bloom:
  - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
  - **Liquid** fertilizer during flowering/fruiting, following label rates.  
- **High‑potassium** or flowering‑specific blends work well.

## 🌸 Flowering Timeline

- Expect **90–120 days** from planting to first blooms.

## ✂️ Cutting & Conditioning – For Stunning Cut Flowers

1. Use sharp snips or secateurs.  
2. Cut the **longest stems** possible.  
3. Remove lower leaves.  
4. Place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.  
5. Follow best practices for home‑grown flower care.

## 🌿 Post‑Bloom Care – Letting the Plant Rest

- **Leave foliage** to die back naturally; the bulb reabsorbs nutrients.  
- Once all leaves are gone, trim them at ground level with sharp tools.  
- **Mulch heavily** in summer to shield bulbs from heat.  
- **Longevity:** Bulbs can stay in the ground for years—no need to lift unless overcrowded or in wet summers.

## ⚠️ Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, honeydew, and attract ants. | • Spray with a garden hose<br>• Use soap or alcohol spray<br>• Invite predatory insects |
| **Rotten bulbs/corms** | Rot, no roots/shoots, stunted yellow leaves, no flowers. | • Plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers<br>• Don’t water during dormancy<br>• Lift and store if climate warrants |
| **Slugs & snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves/shoots, especially at night; leave slimy trails. | • Remove hiding spots<br>• Keep free‑range poultry<br>• Use torchlight to spot<br>• Set traps |
