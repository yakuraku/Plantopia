# How to Grow Cress Seeds

**Family:** Brassicaceae  
**Binomial name:** *Lepidium sativum*  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Aim for **at least 3 hours of full sun** each day; partial shade is fine if the light is bright.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, dig, and loosen the soil.  
  - Add **aged animal manure or compost** to boost fertility.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a variety labeled for container growing.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Pick a pot that holds **≥10 L** for mature plants.  
  - Remember: container plants often need extra fertiliser during the season.

## How to Sow Cress Seeds

Cress seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking or stratification needed.

1. **Direct sow**:  
   - Plant **4 mm deep** and **5–15 cm apart**.  
   - Keep rows **15 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep the soil **moist but never soggy**.  
3. **Germination:**  
   - 6–14 days at **7–15 °C**.  
   - Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather.  
4. **Cool‑season crop:**  
   - Avoid sowing or transplanting in hot weather; cress will bolt.  
5. **Scatter method:**  
   - Roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover.

## How to Grow Cress

- **Watering:**  
  - Keep soil **evenly moist**—never let it dry out.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilising:**  
  - If soil is good, skip extra fertiliser.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release** at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - **Liquid** during the growing season, following the label.  
- **Thinning (optional):**  
  - When seedlings are large enough, pull out weak ones.  
  - Aim for spacing of **5–15 cm**.

## How to Harvest Cress

- **Timing:** Ready to harvest in **15–50 days**.  
- **Method:**  
  - Harvest when leaves are large enough to eat.  
  - Use a **cut‑and‑come‑again** approach: pinch or cut a few outer leaves, leaving some on the plant for regrowth.  
- **Storage:** Keep in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge for short‑term use.

## Common Problems When Growing Cress

| Problem | What to Watch For | Quick Fix |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scab‑like patches; premature leaf/flower drop | Water at soil level, discard fallen debris, rotate crops |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed production | Sow after frost danger, avoid hot weather, water deeply during heat |

*Tip:* Keep an eye on temperature—cress loves cool, not hot, conditions.
