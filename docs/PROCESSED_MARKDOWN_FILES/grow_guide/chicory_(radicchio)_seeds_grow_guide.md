# How to Grow Chicory (Radicchio) Seeds  

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Cichorium intybus_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Chicory loves *full sun* – aim for at least **6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a *well‑drained* mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen, and enrich with **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a container‑friendly variety if you’re growing in pots.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot of at least **40 L**.  
  - Remember: container plants often need extra fertiliser during the season.

## How to Sow Chicory Seeds  

Chicory seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification required.  

1. **Direct sow**: 5 mm deep, 20 cm apart, with rows 30 cm apart.  
2. Keep the soil **moist but not soggy**.  
3. Germination takes **4–10 days** at 15–18 °C.  
4. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

## How to Grow Chicory  

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface; water when dry.  
  - Water *deeply* in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilising:**  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra feed.  
  - In poorer soils or for a boost:  
    - *Slow‑release* fertiliser at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - *Liquid* fertiliser during the growing season, following the product’s rate and frequency.

## How to Harvest Chicory  

- **Timing:** Ready to harvest in **50–65 days**.  
- **Leaves:**  
  - Harvest when they’re large enough to eat.  
  - Cut the outer leaves at the base, leaving some for regrowth.  
  - Store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge; eat soon after cutting.  
- **Hearts:**  
  - Wait until a small head forms at the centre.  
  - Cut the whole plant just above soil level, discarding outer leaves.  
  - Store in a perforated bag in the fridge or pickle for longer storage.  
- **Roots:**  
  - Harvest when the plant is fully grown.  
  - Uproot with a shovel, prune foliage, rinse roots.  
  - For long‑term use: peel or chop, dry, roast, grind, and store in an airtight container.

## Common Problems When Growing Chicory  

| Problem | What to Watch For | Quick Fixes |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Bitter Taste** | Often due to slow growth, setbacks, or late harvest. | • Enrich soil with aged manure.<br>• Water deeply and regularly.<br>• Harvest when young and tender. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves.<br>• Remove and destroy affected leaves.<br>• Avoid overcrowding; improve airflow.<br>• Use a homemade milk spray or fungicide if needed. |
| **Heads Not Forming** | Usually caused by warm weather, slow growth, or lack of water/nutrients. | • Verify you’re growing a head‑forming variety.<br>• In warm climates, plant in autumn or spring.<br>• Water regularly and fertilise with compost or fertiliser. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that munch on tender leaves at night, leaving slimy trails. | • Remove hiding spots.<br>• Keep free‑range poultry.<br>• Use torchlight to spot and collect.<br>• Set traps. |
