# How to Grow Feverfew Seeds

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** *Tanacetum parthenium*  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot** – Feverfew is a long‑lived perennial, so pick a location that won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Sunlight:** Full sun to part shade. Aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:** Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  1. Weed the area thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  3. Mix in aged animal manure or compost.  
  4. Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Container growing:**  
  - Use a variety suited for pots.  
  - Choose a pot **≥ 10 L** to give roots room to grow.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Container plants may need extra fertiliser during the season.

## How to Sow Feverfew Seeds

Feverfew seeds are *easy to start* – no soaking or stratification required.

1. **Seed trays** – Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sow** – Drop seeds **1 mm deep**.  
3. **Moisture** – Keep soil damp, never soggy or dry.  
4. **Germination** – 10–14 days at **20–22 °C**.  
5. **Transplant** – When seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**, move them to the garden.  
6. **Spacing** – Plant 20–40 cm apart.  

*Optional:* In cooler climates, start indoors **6 weeks before the last frost** in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Feverfew

- **Watering**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface; water when it feels dry.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  

- **Fertilising**  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra feed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - *Slow‑release* fertilizer at transplant or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
    - *Liquid* fertilizer during flowering or fruiting.  
  - Choose a high‑potassium or flowering‑plant formula.  

- **Pruning for bushiness**  
  - Pinch off the outermost leaf set on each branch with your fingertips to encourage branching.  

- **Flowering**  
  - Expect blooms in **100–110 days**.  
  - **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading or dead flowers just above a leaf set with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - For cut flowers: snip the longest stems, remove lower leaves, and place immediately in clean water.  

- **Post‑flower pruning**  
  - After flowering, trim back to tidy the plant and stimulate new growth. Cut stems just above a lower leaf set.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; honeydew and ants may appear. | Spray with water, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scabs; leaves and flowers may drop early. | Water at soil level only, discard fallen leaves/fruit, practice crop rotation. |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots that spread to cover leaves; not usually fatal but reduces yield. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves, leaving slimy trails, especially at night. | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, use traps or torchlight collection. |

> *Tip:* Regular inspection and early action keep these issues from taking hold.
