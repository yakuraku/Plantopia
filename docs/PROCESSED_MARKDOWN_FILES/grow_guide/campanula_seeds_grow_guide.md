# How to Grow Campanula Seeds

**Family:** Campanulaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Campanula sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial or Perennial  

## Preparation

### Pick a Permanent Spot  
- **Perennials** need a place where they won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Biennials** can be planted in a more flexible spot, but still benefit from a stable location.

### Self‑Seeding Awareness  
- Campanulas often **self‑seed**: at the end of the season they drop seeds that can germinate the next year.  
- If you don’t want them to take over, **deadhead** before seed drop or grow them in containers.

### Sun & Soil  
- **Sunlight:** 3 h of full sun or part shade is ideal.  
- **Soil:** Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, loosen with a fork, and mix in aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

### Container Growing  
- Choose a variety suited to pots.  
- Use a high‑quality potting mix and a container **≥ 10 L**.  
- Container plants may need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Campanula Seeds

### Direct Sowing  
1. **Depth & Spacing:** 3 mm deep, 30–40 cm apart.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil damp but never waterlogged.  
3. **Germination:** 14–21 days at 18–22 °C.  
4. **Protection:** Shield seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raising Seedlings  
1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. Sow 3 mm deep.  
3. Keep soil moist but not saturated.  
4. Germinate in 14–21 days at 18–22 °C.  
5. Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are 5–10 cm tall.  
6. Space plants 30–40 cm apart in the garden.

### Scatter Seed Method  
- Roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly smooth over.  
- Works well for quick, even coverage.

### Handling Tiny Seeds  
- Seeds are small; mix with sand or fine potting mix before sowing.  
- Use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them.  
- Press lightly into the soil to ensure good contact.  
- Avoid drying out by keeping the surface moist.

## Growing & Caring

### Watering  
- Water when the top 5 cm of soil feels dry (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- **Best times:** early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid** wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilising  
- **If soil is already rich:** no extra fertiliser needed.  
- **If soil is poor or you want a boost:**  
  - *High‑potassium* or flowering‑plant fertilizer works well.  
  - **Slow‑release:** apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
  - **Liquid:** apply during flowering/fruiting as per label instructions.

### Flowering & Deadheading  
- Campanulas typically flower after ~160 days.  
- In cooler climates, flowering may occur in the second year.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: snip fading flowers just above a leaf set with sharp secateurs.  
- This encourages more blooms.

### Pruning & Winter Care  
- After flowering, prune back to tidy the plant and stimulate new growth.  
- Cut stems just above lower leaves.  
- In cold weather, plants may die back; trim them back to ground level in late autumn or remove dead foliage in spring.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Issue | Symptoms | Management |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm), sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with water, use soap or alcohol spray, encourage predatory insects. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scab‑like patches; leaves and flowers drop early. | Water at soil level, remove fallen debris, practice crop rotation. |
| **Grey Mould (Botrytis)** | Mouldy flowers and rotting fruit; spores spread by wind. | Prune affected parts, water at soil level, apply fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Damping Off** | Seeds fail to germinate or seedlings rot at the base. | Use fresh potting mix, avoid over‑watering, keep foliage dry. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; reduces yield. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Root Rot** | Slow growth, yellowing or wilting foliage, soft brown tissue at stem base. | Reduce soil moisture, add organic matter, keep mulch away from stems. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Tender leaves and shoots eaten at night, slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, use poultry, traps, or torchlight collection. |
| **Spider Mites** | Dry, wilted or discolored leaves; undersides feel sandpapery. | Prune for airflow, spray eco‑oil or wettable sulphur. |
| **Thrips** | Small flying insects; larvae leave tiny white or transparent marks on leaves and petals. | Hose off thrips, attract predatory mites and lacewings, use soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |

*All solutions are best applied early, before symptoms become severe.*
