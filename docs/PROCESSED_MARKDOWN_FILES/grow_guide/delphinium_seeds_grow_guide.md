# How to Grow Delphinium Seeds  

**Family:** Ranunculaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Delphinium sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial (often grown as an annual)  

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Pick a spot that gets **at least 3 hours of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:** Needs to be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area.  
  - Dig over the soil to loosen it.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
- **Weed control:** Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.

## How to Sow Delphinium Seeds  

> **Optional:** Stratifying seeds can speed up germination.  
> Stratification means exposing seeds to a cold period that breaks dormancy.  
> *Read more about stratification here.*

1. **Containers:** Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sowing depth:** Drop seeds **5 mm** deep.  
3. **Moisture:** Keep the soil **moist but never wet or dry**.  
4. **Germination:** Seeds should sprout in **10–20 days** at a soil temperature of **18–21 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting:** Move seedlings to the garden once they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing:** Plant out at **30–50 cm** apart.

## How to Grow Delphinium  

- **Watering:**  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Keep the soil **evenly moist** but avoid waterlogging.  
  - **Do not wet the leaves** to prevent fungal diseases.

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, no extra fertilizer is needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or flowering‑plant fertilizer:  
    - *Slow‑release:* Apply at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - *Liquid:* Apply during fruiting or flowering at the recommended rate and frequency.

- **Support:**  
  - Delphiniums can become top-heavy.  
  - Use a **stake, bamboo cane, trellis, or string lines**.  
  - Install support **before sowing or transplanting** to avoid disturbing roots later.

- **Pinching:**  
  - To encourage denser growth and stronger stems, pinch off the growing tips.  
  - Use sharp secateurs or snips to remove the top set of leaves, cutting just above a lower leaf set.

- **Flowering Time:**  
  - Expect blooms in **130–150 days**.

- **Deadheading:**  
  - Regularly remove fading or dead flowers.  
  - Cut just above a set of leaves with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - This encourages more blooms.  
  - *Learn more about deadheading flowering plants here.*

- **Pruning After Flowering:**  
  - Neaten the plant and promote new growth.  
  - Cut individual stems just above a lower leaf set.  
  - Trim each flower spike to **5 cm above ground level**.

## Common Problems When Growing Delphinium  

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Fix |
|---------|--------------------|------------|
| **Damping off** | Seeds fail to germinate or seedlings rot, becoming soft and mushy at the base. | Use fresh potting mix, avoid waterlogged soil, and keep foliage dry. |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves. | Water at soil level only, improve air circulation, remove affected leaves, and consider a suitable fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Slimy trails, tender leaves and shoots eaten, especially at night. | Remove hiding spots, keep poultry, use traps, or spot‑treat with safe slug deterrents. |
