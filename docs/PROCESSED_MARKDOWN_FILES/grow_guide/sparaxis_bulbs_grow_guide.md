# How to Grow Sparaxis Bulbs

**Family:** Iridaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Sparaxis tricolour_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Choose a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Aim for a **loose, well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, then dig to a **spade’s depth** to break up compacted layers.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost**—this lightens heavy soils and feeds roots.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.

## How to Plant Sparaxis Bulbs

1. **Plant in place**—whether in the garden or a container, set each bulb directly in its final spot.  
2. **Spacing & depth:**  
   - Place bulbs **5–10 cm apart**.  
   - Dig a hole **6 cm deep** and set the bulb with the **pointed tip facing up**.  
3. **Cover & water:**  
   - Fill the hole with soil, then give a good soak.  
   - Keep the soil **moist but not waterlogged** until shoots appear.

## How to Grow Sparaxis

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil moisture by feeling **5 cm below the surface**.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
  - For more on watering, see [this guide](#).
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, skip extra fertilizer.  
  - In poorer soils or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium or flowering‑plant fertilizer**:  
    - **Slow‑release:** apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm tall.  
    - **Liquid:** apply during fruiting or flowering, following the label’s rate and frequency.
- **Flowering Time:** Expect blooms in **120–180 days**.  
- **Deadheading:**  
  - Trim spent flowers regularly with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - Cut at the longest stem possible or snap off dead blooms.  
  - This redirects energy back to the bulb rather than seed production.  
- **Foliage Management:**  
  - Let leaves die back naturally after flowering; the bulb will reabsorb nutrients.  
  - Once all foliage has browned, cut individual leaves at ground level with sharp tools.  
- **Longevity & Mulching:**  
  - Bulbs can stay in the ground for years—no need to lift and divide.  
  - **Mulch heavily** during hot summer months to protect bulbs.  
  - In wet summers, or if bulbs become overcrowded, lift and store them.

## Common Problems When Growing Sparaxis

| Problem | What to Watch For | Quick Fix |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Irregular brown spots that dry into scab‑like patches; premature leaf and flower drop. | Water at soil level only, discard fallen leaves/fruit, practice crop rotation. |
| **Rotten Bulbs/Corms** | Bulbs show rot, lack roots/shoots, or produce stunted yellow leaves without flowers. | Plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers; avoid watering during dormancy; lift and store if climate demands. |

*Keep an eye out for these issues and act promptly to keep your Sparaxis healthy and vibrant.*
