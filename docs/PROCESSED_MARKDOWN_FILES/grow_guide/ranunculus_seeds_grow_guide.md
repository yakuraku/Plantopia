# How to Grow Ranunculus Seeds

**Family:** Ranunculaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Ranunculus asiaticus_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Choose a spot that gets **at least 3 h of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen, and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, pick a variety labeled for **container use**.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of **at least 10 L**.  
  - Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Ranunculus Seeds

Ranunculus seeds are simple to start—no soaking or stratification required.

1. **Set‑up:**  
   - Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets).  
2. **Sowing depth:** 2 mm.  
3. **Moisture:** Keep the soil **moist but never soggy or dry**.  
4. **Germination:**  
   - 10–15 days at **18–20 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting:**  
   - Move seedlings once they have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing:** Plant out **20 cm apart**.

> **Tip:** Protect seeds and seedlings from heat.  
> Some growers place the tray on a cool surface (tiled or concrete) or sow later in autumn for optimal germination.

## How to Grow Ranunculus

- **Watering:**  
  - Keep soil **evenly moist** but avoid waterlogging.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  

- **Fertilising:**  
  - If soil is already well‑prepared, **no extra fertiliser** is needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium or flowering‑plant fertilizer**:  
    - *Slow‑release:* apply at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - *Liquid:* apply during fruiting or flowering.  

- **Flowering:**  
  - Ranunculus typically blooms in **120–180 days**.  

- **Deadheading:**  
  - Regularly remove faded or dead flowers **just above a set of leaves** with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - This encourages more blooms.  
  - *Learn more about deadheading flowering plants here.*  

- **Cut‑flower care:**  
  - Use sharp snips or secateurs to cut the **longest stems**.  
  - Remove lower leaves and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.  
  - *Learn more about cutting and conditioning homegrown flowers here.*  

- **Annual vs. Perennial:**  
  - Ranunculus can be grown as **annuals** (discard after flowering) or **perennials** (lift, store, and replant in autumn).  
  - Seed‑grown plants form small corms in their first year.

### Lifting and Storing Corms

1. **Timing:** Lift when foliage turns yellow.  
2. **Procedure:**  
   - Cut foliage at ground level.  
   - Use a garden fork to lift corms, handling gently.  
3. **Drying:** Spread on a wire rack in a **cool, dry place** for 10–14 days.  
4. **Storage:** Keep in a **net bag** or **just‑damp vermiculite** until replanting in autumn.

## Common Problems When Growing Ranunculus

| Problem | Symptoms | Management |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow to grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level, remove/destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding. If persistent, use homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread to cover leaves. | Water at soil level, ensure good airflow, remove affected leaves, spray with appropriate fungicide or homemade spray. *Read more about powdery mildew here.* |
| **Rotten Corms** | Corms rot after sitting in cold, wet soil or being waterlogged; may show no roots or shoots. | Do not over‑soak before planting; plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers. Lift and store over winter if growing perennials. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that eat tender leaves and shoots, leaving slimy trails, mainly at night. | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, collect by torchlight, or use traps. *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
