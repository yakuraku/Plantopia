# How to Grow Black Pearl Lily Bulbs  

**Family:** Asparagaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Ornithogalum arabicum_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Aim for **at least 3 hours of full sun** each day, or partial shade if you’re in a hot climate.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **loose, well‑drained** mix enriched with organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, then dig to **spade depth** (≈30 cm) to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost** to lighten heavy soils and give roots room to grow.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a bulb‑friendly variety if you’re growing in pots.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of **at least 20 L** (≈5 gal).  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the growing season.  

## How to Plant Black Pearl Lily Bulbs  

1. **Spacing & Depth** – Plant each bulb **15 cm apart** and **7 cm deep**, pointed tip up.  
2. **Cover & Water** – Gently cover with soil and water well.  
3. **Moisture** – Keep the soil **moist but not soggy** until shoots appear.  

## Growing & Care  

- **Watering**  
  - Check the soil 5 cm below the surface (scratch a little with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilizing**  
  - If the soil is well‑prepared, no extra fertilizer is needed—bulbs store the energy for next year’s bloom.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium or flowering‑plant fertilizer**:  
    - *Slow‑release* at the recommended rate when shoots emerge, **or**  
    - *Liquid* at the recommended rate and frequency when shoots emerge.  
  - After flowering, feed with **blood & bone** or aged/pelletised chicken manure, then water in well.  
- **Bloom Time** – Expect flowers in **120–180 days**.  
- **Deadheading** – Regularly trim spent blooms with sharp secateurs or snips to redirect energy back to the bulb.  
- **Cut Flowers** – For bouquets, cut the longest stems, remove lower leaves, and place stems in a clean bucket of water immediately.  
- **Foliage Management** – Let leaves die down naturally after flowering; the bulb will reabsorb nutrients. Once all foliage is gone, cut remaining leaves at ground level.  

## Bulb Longevity & Maintenance  

- **In‑ground** – Bulbs can stay planted for years; no need to lift unless overcrowded or you’re moving them.  
- **Mulch** – Apply a heavy mulch layer to shield bulbs from extreme summer heat.  
- **Lifting** – In wet summers, lift bulbs with a garden fork, prune dead leaves, and store in a **cool, dry, well‑ventilated** place (wire rack or netting bag). Ideal storage temperature is around **20 °C**; avoid >30 °C.  
- **Replanting** – Re‑plant stored bulbs the following season following the same planting chart.  

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes  

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2‑4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Rotten bulbs/corms** | Rot, no roots or shoots, stunted yellow leaves, no flowers. | Plant in **free‑draining soil**, raised beds, or containers; **don’t water during dormancy**; lift and store if needed. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Tender leaf damage, slimy trails, mainly at night. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use traps, or spot‑treat with safe slug control. |
