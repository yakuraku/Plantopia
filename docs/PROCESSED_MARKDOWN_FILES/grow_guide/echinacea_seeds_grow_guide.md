## Preparation

Echinacea is a **perennial** that thrives when left undisturbed.  
- **Choose a permanent spot**: Pick a location that won’t be dug up again.  
- **Sunlight**: Full sun to part shade; aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil**: Needs well‑drained, organic‑rich earth.  
  - Weed thoroughly.  
  - Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  - Mix in aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

## How to Sow Echinacea Seeds

### Optional: Stratify for Faster Germination  
Stratification exposes seeds to cold, breaking dormancy and boosting germination speed.  
*(Read more about stratification here.)*

Echinacea can be sown **directly in the garden** or **raised in trays** and transplanted later.

### 1. Sow Directly

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **6 mm deep** and **30–50 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but never waterlogged**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **10–15 days** at **18–21 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raise Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a high‑quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **6 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist but not soggy** soil. |
| 4 | Germination: **10–15 days** at **18–21 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **30–50 cm apart** in the garden. |

> **Tip:** Echinacea seeds can be slow to germinate. Patience and strict adherence to depth and temperature guidelines give the best results.

> **Optional:** In cooler climates, start seeds indoors **6 weeks before the last expected frost**. Grow them in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Echinacea

### Watering  
- Water when the soil feels dry **5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil).  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
*(Learn more about watering here.)*

### Fertilizing  
- If the soil was well prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is needed.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertilizer:  
  - **Slow‑release**: Apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - **Liquid**: Apply during fruiting or flowering, following the product’s rate and frequency.  

### Deadheading  
- Regularly remove faded or dead flowers to encourage more blooms.  
- Use sharp secateurs or snips to cut just above a set of leaves.  
*(Learn more about deadheading flowering plants here.)*

### Winter Care  
- Echinacea may die back in cold weather.  
- Cut back to **just above ground level** in late autumn, or prune dead foliage when new leaves appear in spring.

## How to Harvest Echinacea

- **Harvest window:** **90–140 days** after sowing.  
- Flowers are ready when buds begin to open.  
- Use sharp secateurs or snips to cut the flower heads.  
- **Fresh or dried**:  
  - To dry, spread leaves and flowers on a wire rack in a warm, dry place **out of direct sunlight** until crisp.  
  - Store in an airtight container.

## Common Problems When Growing Echinacea

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention & Treatment |
|---------|----------|------------------------|
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow to grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides | Water at soil level, avoid leaf wetting, remove affected leaves, ensure good airflow. If persistent, use a homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Slimy trails, tender leaf damage, mainly at night | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use traps, or collect by torchlight. *(Read more about slugs and snails here.)* |
