## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Plant in *full sun* or *part shade*—aim for at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Loose, well‑drained, enriched with organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, dig to a *spade’s depth* (≈15 cm) to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost** to lighten heavy soils and give roots room to grow.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a variety suited for container growing.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Minimum pot size: **20 L** (≈5 gal).  
  - Container plants may need extra fertilizer during the growing season.

## Planting Peacock Iris Bulbs

1. **Spacing & Depth**  
   - Plant bulbs **10 cm apart**.  
   - Dig **3 cm deep** with the pointed tip facing **upwards**.  
2. **Cover & Water**  
   - Fill the hole with soil and gently tamp down.  
   - Water well, then keep the soil **moist but not soggy** until shoots appear.

## Growing & Care

### Watering

- Check soil moisture **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a little soil with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
- If soil is poor or you want a boost:  
  - **High‑potassium** or *flowering‑plant* fertilizer works best.  
  - **Options:**  
    - *Slow‑release* fertilizer at the recommended rate when shoots emerge, **or**  
    - *Liquid* fertilizer at the recommended rate and frequency when shoots emerge.  
- After flowering, feed bulbs with **blood & bone** or **aged/pelletised chicken manure** and water well.

### Flowering & Deadheading

- Peacock irises bloom in **120–180 days**.  
- **Deadhead** regularly:  
  - Use sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - Cut flowers with the longest stems for picking, or snap off dead blooms.  
  - This redirects energy back into the bulb instead of seed production.

### Foliage Management

- Let foliage **die down naturally** after flowering.  
- The bulb reabsorbs nutrients from the leaves for next season’s blooms.  
- Once all leaves have browned, trim them to ground level with sharp tools.

### Longevity & Mulching

- Bulbs can stay in the ground for **several years**—no need to lift and divide unless overcrowded or you want to relocate them.  
- **Heavy mulch** protects bulbs from extreme summer heat.

## Bulb Handling (Lifting & Storage)

1. **When to Lift**  
   - In wet summers, if bulbs become overcrowded, or to move them.  
2. **Lifting Technique**  
   - Use a garden fork to gently lift bulbs, avoiding damage.  
   - Prune any dead leaves still attached.  
3. **Storage**  
   - Keep in a **cool, dry** place on a wire rack or a netting bag.  
   - Ideal temperature: **≈20 °C**.  
   - Avoid temperatures **>30 °C**—they can reduce viability.  
4. **Replanting**  
   - Re‑plant the following season following the same planting guidelines.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | - Spray with a garden hose.<br>- Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>- Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Rotten Bulbs/Corms** | Bulbs show rot, lack roots/shoots, or produce stunted yellow leaves. | - Plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers.<br>- Do not water while dormant.<br>- Lift and store if climate warrants. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs nibble tender leaves/shoots at night, leaving slimy trails. | - Remove hiding spots.<br>- Keep free‑range poultry.<br>- Use torchlight to collect or set traps. |
