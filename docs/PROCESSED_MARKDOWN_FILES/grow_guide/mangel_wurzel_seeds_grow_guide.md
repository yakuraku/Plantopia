## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Mangel wurzel loves *full sun* – aim for at least **6 h of direct light** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Loose, well‑drained loam enriched with **organic matter**.  
  - Work the soil to a **spade‑deep** level, then mix in aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Heavy soils can be lightened by adding organic matter so roots can spread freely.  
- **Weeding:** Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.

## How to Sow Mangel Wurzel Seeds

> *Optional:* Seeds don’t need pre‑treatment, but soaking them overnight in room‑temperature water can give a more uniform germination.

1. **Direct sow** in the garden:  
   - Depth: **15 mm**  
   - Spacing: **30 cm** between seedlings, **50 cm** between rows.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil *moist* but never *wet* or *dry*.  
3. **Germination:** 5–10 days at a soil temperature of **10–30 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

## How to Grow Mangel Wurzel

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water *deeply* in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
  - *Learn more* about watering [here](#).  
- **Thinning (Optional):** When seedlings are large enough, pull out weak or small ones so plants are spaced **≈30 cm** apart.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is well‑prepared, skip extra fertilizer.  
  - Over‑fertilizing can lead to lush leaves but weak roots.  
  - In poor soil, use a low‑nitrogen, high‑phosphorus mix (e.g., blood & bone) at the recommended rate.

## How to Harvest Mangel Wurzel

- **Timing:** Roughly **150 days** after sowing.  
- **Leaves:**  
  - Harvest when large enough to eat.  
  - Cut the outer leaves at the base, leaving some for future growth.  
  - Consume or store *short‑term* in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
- **Roots:**  
  - Harvest when large enough to eat.  
  - Pull gently at the leaf base or use a garden fork to lift multiple roots.  
  - Shake off soil, cut foliage 1–2 cm above the root.  
  - Store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.

## Common Problems When Growing Mangel Wurzel

| Problem | Cause | Quick Fix |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Split roots** | Inconsistent watering when roots mature | Water *deeply* and evenly; consider recent rainfall before watering |
| **Tough roots** | Harvested too late | Pick roots while still young and tender |
| **Small roots** | Over‑sowing or over‑fertilizing | Thin seedlings; avoid extra fertilizer |
| **Bolting** | Extreme weather or early sowing | Wait until frost danger passes or temperatures are stable; water deeply during heat |
| **Slugs & snails** | Night‑time feeders | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use traps or torchlight collection |
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Wet spots that dry into scabs | Water at soil level, discard fallen leaves/fruit, practice crop rotation |
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow/grey‑brown patches, especially undersides | Water at soil level, remove/destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding; consider homemade milk spray or fungicide |
| **Boron deficiency** | Yellow leaf tips, hollow stems, soft brown root centers | Mix 1 Tbsp household boron in 5 L water; apply when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall; **do not** use as general fertilizer (boron can be toxic) |
