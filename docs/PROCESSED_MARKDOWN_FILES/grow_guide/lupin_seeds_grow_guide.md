# How to Grow Lupin Seeds

**Family:** Fabaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Lupinus polyphyllus_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

---

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Lupins thrive in **full sun** – pick a spot that gets at least **6 h of direct light** each day.  
- **Longevity:** They’re *short‑lived perennials* (2–5 years). Plant them in a **permanent spot** where you won’t disturb the roots with regular digging.  
- **Soil pH:** Lupins love **alkaline soil** (pH ≥ 7).  
  - If your soil is below 7, add **dolomite** (calcium‑magnesium carbonate) or **garden lime** (calcium carbonate) in powder or liquid form at the recommended rate.  
  - Water well before planting to raise the pH and make nutrients more available.

## How to Sow Lupin Seeds

> *Optional:* Soaking seeds can speed up germination by softening hard seed coats.  
> *Read more about soaking seeds* [here](#).

You can **sow directly** in the garden or **raise seedlings** in trays and transplant later.

### 1. Sow Directly

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | **Plant** seeds **15 mm deep** and **40–60 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist**—never let it dry out or become waterlogged. |
| 3 | Germination takes **15–75 days** at a soil temperature of **12–22 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raise Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **high‑quality seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | **Sow** seeds **15 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Keep soil **moist**—never let it dry out or become waterlogged. |
| 4 | Germination takes **15–75 days** at a soil temperature of **12–22 °C**. |
| 5 | **Transplant** seedlings once they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **40–60 cm apart** when you plant them out. |

> **Tip:** Lupins are *half‑hardy*. Mature plants can handle light frosts, but seedlings need protection until they’re established. **Don’t sow or transplant until after the last frost**.

## How to Grow Lupin

### Watering

- Water when the soil feels **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
- **Deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering is best.  
- Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- *Learn more about watering* [here](#).

### Fertilizing

- If the soil was well‑prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is needed.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flowering‑plant** fertilizer:
  - **Slow‑release**: apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings are **5–10 cm tall**.  
  - **Liquid**: apply at the recommended rate and frequency while plants are fruiting or flowering.

### Support

- Lupins can grow tall and may need support.  
- Use a **stake**, **bamboo cane**, **trellis**, or **string lines**.  
- Install support **before sowing** or transplanting to avoid disturbing roots later.

### Flowering

- Lupins typically **flower in ~200 days**.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading or dead flowers just above a set of leaves with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - This encourages more blooms.  
  - *Learn more about deadheading* [here](#).  
- After flowering, **prune** back to tidy the plant and promote strong new growth.  
  - Cut stems just above a set of lower leaves.  
- For cut flowers: cut the longest stems possible, remove lower leaves, and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.  
  - *Learn more about cutting and conditioning* [here](#).  
- Lupins may die back in cold weather. In late autumn, cut plants back just above ground level, or prune dead foliage when new leaves appear in spring.

## Common Problems When Growing Lupin

| Problem | Description | Management |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects that cluster on new shoots or leaf undersides. They can wilt leaves, discolor them, and excrete honeydew that attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose to dislodge them. <br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray. <br>• Encourage natural predators (ladybirds, lacewings). <br>• *Read more about aphids* [here](#). |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that feed on tender leaves and shoots, mainly at night, leaving slimy trails. | • Remove hiding places (rock piles, mulch). <br>• Keep free‑range poultry. <br>• Spot‑collect by torchlight or use traps. <br>• *Read more about slugs and snails* [here](#). |
