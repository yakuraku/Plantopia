- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, choose a variety labeled **“container‑friendly.”**  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot of **at least 10 L** (≈2.5 gal).

## How to Sow Strawberry Seeds

Strawberry seeds are tiny but mighty. They **don’t need any pre‑treatment** (no soaking or stratification).

1. **Choose the right container** – trays, punnets, or jiffy pots.  
2. **Fill** with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
3. **Sow** seeds **3 mm deep**.  
4. **Moisture:** Keep the soil *moist but never soggy or dry*.  
5. **Germination:** 14–56 days at **15–18 °C**.  
6. **Transplant** when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
7. **Spacing:** 15–30 cm between plants, rows 30–40 cm apart.

**Tip:** Because the seeds are so small, mix them with a little sand or fine potting mix before sowing, or use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly. Press lightly into the soil to ensure good contact.

## How to Grow Strawberry Plants

### Watering

- **Keep soil evenly moist**—never let it dry out, but avoid waterlogging.  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Skip the leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
  - **Liquid** fertilizer during fruiting or flowering, following the recommended rate and frequency.

**Tip:** Mulch under ripening fruit with straw or sugar‑cane to help prevent rot.

## How to Harvest Strawberries

- **Harvest window:** ~140–160 days after sowing.  
- **When ripe:** Fully colored, fragrant fruit.  
- **Method:** Cut with snips or twist to separate from the stem.  
- **Frequency:** Harvest regularly to encourage more fruit.  
- **Enjoy:** Eat fresh soon after picking.  
- **Storage:** Short‑term in a fridge container; for longer storage, freeze or make preserves.

## Common Problems When Growing Strawberries

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Grey Mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Mouldy flowers and rotting fruit, especially in cool, damp weather. | • Prune affected flowers/fruit.<br>• Water at soil level (not on leaves).<br>• Apply suitable fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Armyworms, Cutworms & Caterpillars** | Inside fruit, leaving small holes. | • Inspect fruit regularly.<br>• Remove caterpillars.<br>• Use exclusion netting or fruit bags.<br>• Spray with Dipel if needed. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches on leaf undersides. | • Water at soil level.<br>• Remove and destroy affected leaves.<br>• Avoid overcrowding for better airflow.<br>• Use homemade milk spray or fungicide if persistent. |
| **Animals (Possums, Birds, etc.)** | Can destroy a large portion of the harvest overnight. | • Use netting or cages.<br>• Spray with a pungent homemade deterrent (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Feed on tender leaves/shoots, leaving slimy trails. | • Remove hiding places.<br>• Keep free‑range poultry.<br>• Collect by torchlight or use traps.<br>• Read more [here](#). |
