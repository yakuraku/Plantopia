# How to Grow Jerusalem Artichoke Tubers

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Helianthus tuberosus_  
**Life Cycle:** perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Choose a spot that receives **at least 6 hours of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs to be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, dig it over to loosen, and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Jerusalem artichoke can thrive in sandy soil* if it remains well drained.  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you prefer pots, pick a variety labeled for container growing.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a **minimum of 75 L** (about 20 gal) to give the tubers room to expand.  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the season to stay vigorous.

## How to Plant Jerusalem Artichoke Tubers

1. **Timing:** Plant **right after delivery**.  
2. **Storage before planting:** Keep tubers in **damp sawdust or potting mix** in a well‑ventilated spot for short‑term storage.  
3. **Spacing:** Place tubers **30 cm apart**.  
4. **Depth:** Bury each tuber **10 cm deep** and cover with soil.  
5. **Watering:** Water well immediately after planting.  
6. **Mulch:** Apply **straw, sugar‑cane mulch, or a similar organic mulch** to suppress weeds until shoots appear.

## How to Grow Jerusalem Artichoke

- **Watering:**  
  - Check the soil **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is already fertile, **no extra fertilizer** is needed.  
  - In poorer soils or for a boost:  
    - *Slow‑release fertilizer* at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm tall**.  
    - *Liquid fertilizer* at the recommended rate and frequency during fruiting or flowering.

## How to Harvest Jerusalem Artichoke

- **Timing:** Tubers are ready in about **250 days**.  
- **Indicators:**  
  - In cold climates, wait until stems **die back**.  
  - In warm climates, harvest **4–6 weeks after flowering**.  
  - In frost‑prone areas, leaving tubers in the ground until after the first frost can make them sweeter.  
- **Method:** Use a fork to gently lift the whole plant, shake off excess soil, and collect the tubers.  
- **Next Year:** Small tubers can be left in the ground to grow again.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Tubers don’t store as well as potatoes.  
  - Keep them in a **perforated plastic bag in the fridge** for short‑term storage, or leave them in the ground until needed.

## Common Problems When Growing Jerusalem Artichoke

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention & Management |
|---------|----------|-------------------------|
| **Rotten bulbs or corms** | Bulbs show obvious rot, lack roots or shoots, or produce stunted yellow leaves without flowers. | Plant in **free‑draining soil**, raised beds, or containers. Avoid watering during dormancy. Lift and store bulbs if your climate requires it. |
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots that spread to cover leaves; reduces yield but rarely fatal. | Water at soil level only, ensure good airflow, remove affected leaves, and apply an appropriate fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Molluscs that feed on tender leaves and shoots, leaving slimy trails, especially at night. | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, collect by torchlight, or use traps. |
