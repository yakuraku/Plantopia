# How to Grow Cucumber Seeds

**Family:** Cucurbitaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Cucumis sativus_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Choose a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly **weed** the area, then **dig over** to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost** for extra nutrients.  
- Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.

## How to Sow Cucumber Seeds

Cucumbers are simple to start—no soaking or stratification needed.

1. **Direct sow** seeds **10 mm deep**.  
2. Space seeds **40–60 cm apart** within rows that are **100–120 cm apart**.  
3. Keep the soil **moist but not soggy**.  
4. Germination takes **4–10 days** at a soil temperature of **18–35 °C**.  
5. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  

> **Tip:** Cucumbers are frost‑sensitive. **Never transplant or sow outdoors** until the danger of frost has passed.

## How to Grow Cucumber

### Watering

- Check soil moisture **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid wetting the leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- Learn more about proper watering in [Watering Guide](#).

### Fertilizing

- If the soil is well‑prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is usually needed.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release fertilizer** at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm** tall.  
  - **Liquid fertilizer** at the recommended rate and frequency during fruiting or flowering.

### Vining & Support

- **Ground growth:** Allow at least **2 m² per plant**.  
- **Trellis growth:** Plants use tendrils to climb; add extra support with **twine or plant ties**.  
- **Set up support** **before** sowing or transplanting to avoid disturbing roots later.

## How to Harvest Cucumber

- **Harvest window:** **60–90 days** after sowing.  
- **Ready to pick:** Skin is glossy, fruit is large enough to eat, and still tender.  
- **Cut** the cucumber, leaving a small stem attached.  
- **Store** in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
- For longer storage, consider **pickling**.

## Common Problems When Growing Cucumber

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Not Setting Fruit** | Flowers fall off or tiny fruit shrivel and rot. | Ensure both male and female flowers are present. Use a paintbrush to transfer pollen from male to female flowers. |
| **Animals (possums, birds, etc.)** | Large harvest loss overnight. | Use netting or cages; try a homemade spray of garlic, fish oil, or mustard. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; can reduce yield. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, and apply a fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Spider Mites** | Dry, wilted, or discolored leaves; undersides feel sandpaper‑like. | Prune for airflow, spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulfur. |
| **Sunscald** | White marks or blisters on fruit, especially on unripe fruit. | Don’t prune leaves during peak summer; use light fabric to shade on very hot days. |
