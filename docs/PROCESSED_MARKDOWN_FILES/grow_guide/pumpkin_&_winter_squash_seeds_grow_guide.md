# How to Grow Pumpkin & Winter Squash Seeds

**Family:** Curcurbitaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Cucurbita spp._  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Choose a spot that receives **at least 6 hours of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly **weed** the area, then **dig over** to loosen the soil.  
  - Add **aged animal manure** or **compost** to boost fertility.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Container Growing (Bush varieties):**  
  - Pick a variety labeled **“container‑friendly.”**  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Containers should be **at least 40 L** to accommodate mature plants.  
  - Remember that container plants often need **extra fertiliser** to stay healthy.

## How to Sow Pumpkin and Winter Squash Seeds

- **No pre‑treatment needed** (no soaking or stratification).  
- **Direct sow** into the garden for best results.  
  1. Plant seeds **20 mm deep**.  
  2. Space them **100–150 cm apart**; keep rows **100–120 cm apart**.  
  3. Keep the soil **moist but not waterlogged or dry**.  
  4. Germination takes **5–10 days** at a soil temperature of **21–35 °C**.  
  5. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  
- **Frost caution:** Pumpkin and winter squash are tender; **don’t transplant or sow until all frost danger has passed.**

## How to Grow Pumpkin and Winter Squash

### Watering

- Water when the soil feels **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (check by finger).  
- Aim for **deep, infrequent** watering in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
- **Avoid wetting the leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- *Learn more about watering here.*

### Fertilising

- If the soil was well‑prepared, **no extra fertiliser** is usually needed.  
- For poorer soils or a quick boost:  
  - **Slow‑release fertiliser** at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm tall**.  
  - **Liquid fertiliser** at the recommended rate and frequency during fruiting or flowering.

### Vines vs. Bushes

- **Vine pumpkins:**  
  - Can **sprawl on the ground** or climb a **strong trellis**.  
  - Ground‑grown vines need **at least 2 m² per plant**.  
  - Trellis‑grown vines use tendrils; add **twine or plant ties** for extra support.  
  - Large fruit may require a **netting sling**.  
  - **Set up support before sowing** to avoid disturbing roots later.  
  - *Tip:* Mulch under ripening fruit with **straw or sugar cane** to prevent rot.

- **Bush pumpkins:**  
  - Grow in **containers** or **small beds**; ensure ample space and good drainage.

## How to Harvest Pumpkin and Winter Squash

- **Harvest window:** **100–140 days** after sowing.  
- **Signs of maturity:**  
  - Stems become **tough and woody**.  
  - Leaves turn **dry and brown**.  
- **Method:** Cut the fruit from the vine or bush, leaving **5–10 cm of stem** attached.  
- **Curing:** Let the fruit **air‑dry for a week** in a single layer, away from direct sun and frost.  
- **Storage:** Keep in a **dark, dry place** at **10–16 °C**.  
  - Rotate regularly and discard any fruit showing rot.

## Common Problems When Growing Pumpkin and Winter Squash

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fixes |
|---------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Aphids** | Tiny (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose. <br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray. <br>• Encourage natural predators (ladybugs, lacewings). <br>• *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Not setting fruit** | Flowers fall off or tiny fruit shrivel and rot—often due to poor pollination. | • Wait until both male and female flowers appear. <br>• Transfer pollen with a paintbrush. <br>• *Learn more about hand pollination here.* |
| **Possums, birds, other animals** | Sudden loss of fruit overnight. | • Use netting or cages to exclude pests. <br>• Spray with a homemade deterrent (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; reduces yield but rarely kills the plant. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves. <br>• Ensure good airflow between plants. <br>• Remove affected leaves. <br>• Apply a suitable fungicide or homemade spray. <br>• *Read more about powdery mildew here.* |
