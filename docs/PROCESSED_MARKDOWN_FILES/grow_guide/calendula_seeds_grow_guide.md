# How to Grow Calendula Seeds

Calendula, the bright and cheerful **pot marigold**, is a hardy annual that brings sunshine to any garden.  

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Calendula officinalis_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

Calendula loves to self‑seed. At the end of the season, the plants drop seeds that can sprout the next year.  
- **If you want a tidy garden**: deadhead before seed drop or grow in containers.  
- **Sunlight**: Full sun or part shade. Aim for **at least 3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil**: Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, loosen the soil, and add aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

- **Container growing**:  
  - Choose a variety suited for pots.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - **Minimum 10 L pot** for mature plants.  
  - Containers may need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Calendula Seeds

Calendula seeds are simple to handle—no soaking or stratification required.  
You can sow them **directly in the garden** or **raise seedlings** in trays and transplant later.

### Sow Directly

1. **Depth & spacing**: 15 mm deep, 50–60 cm apart, with rows 60 cm apart.  
2. Keep the soil **moist but never soggy or dry**.  
3. Germination: **7–14 days** at **20–22 °C**.  
4. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raise Seedlings First

1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix (or soil starter pellets).  
2. Sow seeds 15 mm deep.  
3. Maintain moist soil (but not waterlogged).  
4. Germination: **7–14 days** at **20–22 °C**.  
5. Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. Plant out at **50–60 cm spacing**, rows 60 cm apart.

## How to Grow Calendula

### Watering

- Water when the soil is dry **≈5 cm below the surface** (check by scratching a bit of soil).  
- **Deep watering** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- Avoid wetting the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.

### Fertilising

- Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra fertiliser.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertiliser:  
  - **Slow‑release**: apply at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
  - **Liquid**: apply at the recommended rate during flowering or fruiting.  

### Flowering & Deadheading

- Calendula blooms in **70–80 days**.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading or dead flowers just above a leaf set with sharp secateurs or snips.  
- This encourages continuous blooming.  
- *Learn more about deadheading flowering plants here.*

### Harvesting & Drying

- Harvest in the late morning when petals are fully open.  
- Cut the whole flower head and trim the stem with clean, sharp tools.  
- **Drying**:  
  - Spread flowers on a tray or wire rack in a warm, dry, sun‑shaded spot until crisp.  
  - Or use a dehydrator.  

## Common Problems When Growing Calendula

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew attracting ants. | • Spray with a garden hose. <br>• Use soap or alcohol spray. <br>• Encourage predatory insects. <br>• *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._) | Brown to orange raised spots or patches on foliage; spreads by wind or water, especially at 10–20 °C and high humidity. | • Space plants to avoid overcrowding. <br>• Provide full sun. <br>• Avoid over‑fertilising. <br>• Remove dead plants and practice crop rotation. <br>• *Read more about rust fungus here.* |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that expand to cover leaves; reduces yield but rarely fatal. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves. <br>• Ensure good airflow. <br>• Remove affected leaves. <br>• Use fungicide or homemade spray if needed. <br>• *Read more about powdery mildew here.* |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves at night, leaving slimy trails. | • Remove hiding places. <br>• Keep free‑range poultry. <br>• Collect by torchlight or use traps. <br>• *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
| **Spider Mites** (Tetranychus urticae) | Dry, wilted, or discolored leaves; undersides feel sandpaper‑like. | • Prune for airflow. <br>• Spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulphur. <br>• *Read more about managing spider mites here.* |
