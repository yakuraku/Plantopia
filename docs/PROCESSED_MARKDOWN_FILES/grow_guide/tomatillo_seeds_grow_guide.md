# How to Grow Tomatillo Seeds

**Family:** Solanaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Physalis spp._  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

### Sunlight  
- **Tomatillo plants thrive in full sun.**  
- Choose a spot that receives **at least 6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.

### Soil  
- *Tomatillo plants need a well‑drained soil enriched with plenty of organic matter.*  
- **Weed thoroughly, dig over, and add aged animal manure or compost.**  
- Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- Learn more about preparing soil for planting [here](#).

### Container Growing  
- Tomatillos can be grown in pots.  
- **Select a variety recommended for container use.**  
- Use a high‑quality potting mix and a container **at least 40 L** in size.  
- During the growing season, container plants may need **additional fertilizer** to stay healthy.

## How to Sow Tomatillo Seeds

- Tomatillo seeds **do not require any pre‑treatment** (e.g., soaking, stratification).  
- They grow best when raised in trays or other containers and transplanted once established.

1. **Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots** with a good quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sow seeds 4 mm deep.**  
3. Keep the soil **moist but never wet or dry.**  
4. Seeds should **germinate in 15‑20 days** at a soil temperature of **21‑28 °C**.  
5. **Transplant seedlings** to the garden when they have their first true leaves and are **5‑10 cm tall**.  
6. **Plant out, spacing 50 cm apart.**

- **Tomatillo is a tender crop** sensitive to frost.  
- **Do not transplant or sow outdoors** until all danger of frost has passed.  
- *Optional:* In cool climates, start seeds indoors **6 weeks before** the last expected frost. Grow them in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Tomatillo

### Watering  
- Water when the soil is **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a little soil with your finger).  
- Water **deeply in the early morning or late afternoon**.  
- **Avoid wetting the leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- Learn more about watering [here](#).

### Fertilizing  
- If the soil was well prepared, **no extra fertilizer is needed**.  
- In poor soil or to give an extra boost, use a balanced or fruit/veg‑specific fertilizer:

  * **Slow‑release fertilizer** – apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings are 5‑10 cm tall.  
  * **Liquid fertilizer** – apply at the recommended rate and frequency while plants are fruiting or flowering.

### Staking & Support  
- Tomatillo plants need a **sturdy stake, trellis, or tripod**.  
- As they grow, **tie stems gently** to the support using twine or plant ties.  
- **Set up support before sowing or transplanting** to avoid disturbing roots later.

### Pollination  
- **Tomatillos are poor self‑pollinators.**  
- Grow **several plants together** to improve pollination and yield.

## How to Harvest Tomatillos

- Harvest time: **70‑90 days** after planting.  
- Fruit is ready when the **papery husk dries and begins to split**.  
- Harvest by **cutting with snips/​secateurs** or **twisting** to separate from the stem.  
- Pull back the husk and separate it from the fruit.  
- **Harvest regularly** to encourage more fruit.  

  * **Short‑term storage:** Keep fruit in its husk in a paper bag in the fridge.  
  * **Long‑term storage:** Freeze or can the fruit.

## Common Problems When Growing Tomatillos

| Problem | Description | Management Tips |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2‑4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides. They cause wilting, discoloration, and excrete honeydew that attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose<br>• Use soap or alcohol spray<br>• Encourage predatory insects |
| **Queensland Fruit Fly** _(Bactrocera tryoni)_ | Lays eggs in fruit, causing internal rot and premature drop. | • Dispose of fallen fruit<br>• Use insect exclusion netting<br>• Install traps to monitor populations |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insect, often in large numbers on leaf undersides. Causes yellowing, wilting, and stunted growth. | • Hose spray or soap spray<br>• Destroy badly affected plants<br>• Attract beneficial insects |
| **Blossom End Rot** | Calcium deficiency from inconsistent watering. Fruit darkens from the bottom up. | • Dispose of affected fruit<br>• Water regularly and evenly<br>• Correct soil pH and nutrients |
| **Animals (possums, birds, etc.)** | Can destroy a large portion of the harvest overnight. | • Use netting or cages<br>• Spray with homemade deterrents (garlic, fish oil, mustard) |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium Wilt** | Soil‑borne fungi that block water and nutrient flow, causing wilting, yellowing, and death. | • Choose resistant varieties<br>• Dispose of affected plants and soil<br>• Practice good hygiene and crop rotation |
| **No Fruit** | Often due to high temperatures, wind, or lack of cross‑pollination. | • Plant in a wind‑protected spot<br>• Grow several plants together for insect pollination |
| **Cutworms** | Moth larvae that chew through tender seedlings at night. | • Hand‑pick at night<br>• Use cardboard collars to protect stems |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Brown, scab‑like spots on leaves and flowers that can cause premature drop. | • Water at soil level<br>• Dispose of fallen leaves and fruit<br>• Rotate crops |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White fungal spores on leaves that spread quickly. | • Water at soil level<br>• Ensure good airflow<br>• Remove affected leaves<br>• Use appropriate fungicide or homemade spray |
