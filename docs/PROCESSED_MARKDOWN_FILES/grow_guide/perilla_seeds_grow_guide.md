**Binomial name:** *Perilla frutescens*  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

---

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Perilla thrives in **full sun or part shade**. Aim for at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, dig, and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, choose a variety labeled **“container‑friendly.”**  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of at least **20 L**.  
  - Container plants often need extra fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Perilla Seeds

Perilla seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking or stratification required.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **1 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Keep the soil **moist but not soggy**. |
| 4 | Germination takes **7–21 days** at a soil temperature of **19–21 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant seedlings once they develop their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **30 cm apart** when planting out. |

> **Tip:** Use fresh seeds each year—perilla seeds don’t store well long‑term.

> **Caution:** Perilla is frost‑sensitive. Wait until all danger of frost has passed before sowing outdoors or transplanting seedlings.

## How to Grow Perilla

- **Watering:**  
  - Keep the soil **evenly moist** but never waterlogged.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is usually needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑nitrogen fertilizer** or one formulated for leafy greens/herbs.  
    - **Slow‑release:** Apply at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid:** Follow the recommended rate and frequency during the growing season.

## How to Harvest Perilla

- **Timing:** Harvest in **80–95 days** after sowing.  
- **Leaves:**  
  - Pick when they’re large enough to eat.  
  - **Pinch off outer leaves**, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
  - Consume fresh as soon as possible.  
  - For short‑term storage, keep in a **perforated plastic bag** in the fridge.  
  - For longer storage, consider **pickling** the leaves.

## Common Problems When Growing Perilla

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Damping Off** | Seeds fail to germinate or seedlings rot, becoming soft and mushy at the base. | • Use fresh potting mix.<br>• Avoid watering foliage.<br>• Keep soil from becoming waterlogged. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves.<br>• Remove and destroy affected leaves.<br>• Avoid overcrowding; ensure good airflow.<br>• If needed, spray with a homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Poor Germination** | Seeds take longer than expected or fail to sprout. | • Use fresh seed each year.<br>• Note sowing date and expected germination window.<br>• Ensure optimal soil temperature. |
| **Spider Mites** (Tetranychus urticae) | Dry, wilted, or discolored leaves; undersides feel sandpaper‑like. | • Prune for better airflow.<br>• Spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulfur. |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insects on leaf undersides; can swarm in clouds when disturbed. | • Spray with a garden hose or soap spray.<br>• Destroy severely affected plants.<br>• Attract beneficial predators. |

> **Pro Tip:** Regularly inspect your plants for early signs of these issues—early intervention saves the crop!
