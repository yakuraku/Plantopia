**Binomial name:** *Capparis spinosa*  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

---

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Capers love *full sun* – aim for **at least 6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Location:** Since they’re **perennials**, plant in a spot that won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs to be **well‑drained**; avoid heavy, clay soils that hold water.  
  - No need for manure or heavy fertilisers in most cases.  
  - **Weed** the area thoroughly and loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.

## How to Sow Caper Bush Seeds

Stratifying seeds can boost germination speed and success.  
*Stratification* means exposing seeds to a period of cold to break dormancy.  
*Read more about stratification here.*

**Step‑by‑step:**

1. **Containers:** Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots filled with a high‑quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sowing depth:** Plant seeds **2 mm** deep.  
3. **Moisture:** Keep the soil **moist**—never soggy or dry.  
4. **Temperature & time:** Germination takes **14–28 days** at **20–25 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting:** Move seedlings outdoors once they develop their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm** tall.  
6. **Spacing:** When planting in the garden, space each plant **150 cm** apart.

> **Tip:** Caper seeds can be slow to germinate. Patience, proper depth, and temperature are key.

**Optional indoor start:** In cooler climates, sow seeds indoors **6 weeks** before the last expected frost. Grow them in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Caper Bush

### Watering

- **First 2 years:** Water during the growing season when the soil feels dry **5 cm** below the surface.  
- **After establishment:** Capers are drought‑tolerant and thrive in *dry, well‑drained* soil.  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings; test by scratching a little soil with your finger—water only when it’s dry **10 cm** below the surface.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising

- If the soil is already well‑prepared, **no extra fertiliser** is needed.  
- In poorer soils or for a boost, use a balanced fertiliser or one formulated for fruits and vegetables:  
  - **Slow‑release**: Apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - **Liquid**: Apply during fruiting or flowering, following the product’s recommended rate and frequency.

### Pruning & Growth

- Capers are **deciduous or semi‑deciduous**.  
- **Winter pruning:** Cut branches hard to encourage dense new growth; buds and fruit grow on the new season’s shoots.  
- **Growth rate:** They’re slow growers—expect **3–4 years** before buds and flowers appear.

## How to Harvest Caper Bush

- **Timing:** Harvest begins around **3–4 years** after planting.  
- **Edible parts:**  
  - **Buds (capers)** – not edible raw.  
  - **Berries (caperberries)** – also not edible raw.

### Buds

- Harvest when they’re **pea‑size**.  
- Use your thumb and forefinger to twist and remove them.  
- Harvest regularly to keep the plant productive.  
- **Preservation:** Caper buds can be cured in salt or pickled in vinegar.

### Berries

- They form after the flowers fade.  
- Harvest when they’re **6–8 cm** long.  
- Cut with snips or twist to detach.  
- **Preservation:** Soak in salty water, then pickle in vinegar.

## Common Problems When Growing Caper Bush

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention / Control |
|---------|----------|----------------------|
| **Cabbage moth / cabbage white butterfly** | White or grey wings with markings; eggs on leaf undersides; caterpillars create holes or skeletonise leaves. | Use netting or decoys to exclude them. Pick off caterpillars or apply a targeted spray. *Read more about cabbage moth and cabbage white butterfly here.* |
| **Slugs & snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves and shoots, especially at night; leave slimy trails. | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, spot‑collect at night, or set traps. *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
