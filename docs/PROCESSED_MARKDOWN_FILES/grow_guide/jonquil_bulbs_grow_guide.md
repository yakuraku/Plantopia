## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Aim for *at least 3 hours of full sun* per day, or a sunny spot with some afternoon shade.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Loose, well‑drained loam or sandy loam.  
  - Enrich with **aged animal manure** or **compost** to add organic matter.  
  - For heavy clay soils, dig in organic material to lighten the texture and allow roots to spread.  
- **Weeding:** Remove all weeds before planting; keep the area weed‑free until the bulbs are established.  
- **Containers:** If you’re growing in pots, choose a **10 L (≈2.5 gal) or larger** pot. Use a high‑quality potting mix and remember that container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Plant Jonquil Bulbs

1. **Spacing:** Plant bulbs **10–15 cm apart**.  
2. **Depth:** Dig a hole **10–15 cm deep**; place the bulb with its pointed tip facing **upward**.  
3. **Cover & Water:** Fill the hole with soil, firm gently, then water well.  
4. **After Planting:** Keep the soil **moist but not soggy** until shoots appear.

## Growing Jonquils

### Watering

- Check the soil 5 cm below the surface; water when it feels dry.  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid leaf wetness and fungal issues.  
- *Tip:* Use a finger or a moisture meter to gauge dryness.

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra feed; bulbs store enough energy from last year’s growth.  
- In poorer soils or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flowering‑plant** fertilizer:
  - **Slow‑release**: apply at the recommended rate when shoots first emerge.  
  - **Liquid**: apply at the recommended rate and frequency when shoots first emerge.  
- After flowering, feed with **blood & bone** or **aged/pelletised chicken manure**, then water in well.

### Flowering

- Jonquils typically bloom **60–90 days** after planting.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: snip flowers with the longest stems possible or snap off faded blooms. This redirects energy back into the bulb rather than seed production.

### Foliage Care

- Let the leaves **die back naturally** after flowering; the bulb reabsorbs nutrients for next season’s blooms.  
- Once all foliage has browned, trim individual leaves at ground level with sharp secateurs or snips.

## Bulb Longevity & Management

- **In‑ground life:** Bulbs can stay planted for many years; no need to lift unless overcrowded or the area gets wet in summer.  
- **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer of mulch to shield bulbs from extreme summer heat.  
- **Lifting (if needed):**  
  1. Use a garden fork to gently lift bulbs, avoiding damage.  
  2. Prune any dead leaves still attached.  
  3. Store in a **cool, dry** place on a wire rack or a breathable netting bag.  
  4. Ideal storage temperature: **≈20 °C**; avoid >30 °C to preserve viability.  
  5. Re‑plant the following season following the same planting guidelines.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap/alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Rotten bulbs/corms** | Bulbs show rot, lack roots/shoots, or produce stunted yellow leaves. | Plant in well‑drained soil or raised beds; avoid water during dormancy; lift and store if climate is wet. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Night‑time feeders leaving slimy trails on tender leaves. | Remove hiding spots, use poultry, set traps, or torchlight collection. |
| **Thrips** | Tiny (≤1.5 mm) black/beige/white insects; larvae leave small white/transparent marks on leaves and petals. | Wash with a garden hose, encourage predatory mites/lacewings, or spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |
