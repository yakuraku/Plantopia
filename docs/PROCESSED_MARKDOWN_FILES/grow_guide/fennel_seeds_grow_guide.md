# How to Grow Fennel Seeds

**Family:** Apiaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Foeniculum vulgare_  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Fennel loves *full sun* – aim for **at least 6 hours a day**.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs to be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, dig over, and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Containers:**  
  - Fennel can thrive in pots.  
  - Choose a variety labeled **“container‑friendly.”**  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot of **at least 40 L** for mature plants.  
  - Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Fennel Seeds

Fennel seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification required.  
**Direct sowing** is the best approach.

1. **Depth & spacing**  
   - Sow 8 mm deep, **40 cm apart**.  
   - Rows should be **60 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture** – keep soil **moist but never soggy**.  
3. **Germination** – 7–14 days at **10–30 °C**.  
4. **Protection** – shield seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  
5. **Temperature note** – fennel is a cool‑season crop; avoid sowing or transplanting in very hot weather to prevent premature bolting.

## How to Grow Fennel

- **Watering**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface; water when it’s dry.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  
- **Fertilising**  
  - If soil is already well‑prepared, no extra fertiliser is needed.  
  - For poorer soils or a growth boost:  
    - **Slow‑release** fertiliser at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - **Liquid** fertiliser during fruiting or flowering, following the recommended rate and frequency.  
  - Use a balanced or vegetable‑specific formula.

## How to Harvest Fennel

- **Timing** – ready in **80–100 days**.  
- **Leaves**  
  - Harvest when large enough to eat.  
  - Pinch off outer leaves, leaving some for regrowth.  
  - Consume fresh or store **short‑term** in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
- **Seeds**  
  - Harvest when flower heads start to dry and turn brown, *before* seeds fall.  
  - Cut whole heads, place in a paper bag, and store in a cool, dry place for a couple of weeks until fully dry.  
  - Shake out seeds, remove chaff, and store long‑term in an airtight container or jar at room temperature.

## Common Problems When Growing Fennel

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Fix |
|---------|--------------------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose. <br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray. <br>• Invite predatory insects. <br>• *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set, often after extreme heat or cold. | • Don’t sow until after the frost danger. <br>• Avoid very hot weather. <br>• Water deeply and regularly during heat stress. |
| **Bulbs Not Forming** | No bulb development; often due to wrong variety, wrong season, heat, or inconsistent watering. | • Plant the recommended variety (e.g., Florence fennel). <br>• Sow at the right time. <br>• Keep soil evenly moist but not waterlogged. |
| **Cutworms** | Moth larvae (3–4 cm, white/grey/brown) that chew through tender stems at night. | • Hand‑pick at night. <br>• Use cardboard collars to protect seedlings. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that nibble tender leaves, leaving slimy trails. | • Remove hiding places. <br>• Keep free‑range poultry. <br>• Spot‑collect with a torchlight. <br>• Set traps. <br>• *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
