## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Snowflakes thrive in **full sun or part shade**. Aim for at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Location:** They’re hard to eradicate once established. Pick a **permanent spot** in a garden bed or grow them in **containers** to keep them from spreading.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs to be **loose, well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Weigh out the area, **weed thoroughly**, then dig to at least a spade’s depth.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost** to lighten heavy soils and give roots room to grow.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Container Growing:**  
  - Choose a variety suited for pots.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a container of **at least 20 L**.  
  - Containers may need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Plant Snowflakes Bulbs

1. **Planting depth & spacing**  
   - Place bulbs **10–15 cm apart**.  
   - Dig **10 cm deep** and position the pointed tip **upwards**.  
2. **Cover & Water**  
   - Fill the hole with soil and water well.  
   - Keep the soil **moist but not soggy** until shoots appear.

## Growing & Care

### Watering  
- Check the soil **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
- Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilising  
- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra feed.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertiliser:  
  - **Slow‑release**: apply at transplanting or when seedlings are **5–10 cm tall**.  
  - **Liquid**: apply during flowering or fruiting, following the label’s rate and frequency.

### Flowering  
- Expect blooms in **90–120 days**.  
- For cut flowers:  
  - Use **sharp snips or secateurs** to cut the longest stems.  
  - Remove lower leaves and place stems in a clean bucket of water immediately.  

### Post‑Flower Care  
- Let the foliage **die back naturally**; the bulb will absorb nutrients for next season.  
- Once all leaves have browned, trim them at ground level with sharp tools.  

### Longevity  
- Bulbs can stay in the ground for **years** without lifting.  
- **Heavy mulch** protects them from summer heat.  
- Lift only if the area gets wet in summer, if bulbs become overcrowded, or if you wish to relocate them.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | What Happens | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small sap‑suckers (2–4 mm) on new shoots or leaf undersides. They wilt leaves, discolor them, and excrete honeydew that attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Rotten bulbs/corms** | Caused by pathogens after sitting in cold, wet soil or being waterlogged. Symptoms: rot, no roots/shoots, stunted yellow leaves, no flowers. | Plant in **free‑draining soil**, raised beds, or containers. **Don’t water** while dormant. Lift and store bulbs if your climate requires it. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Molluscs that munch on tender leaves and shoots, especially at night, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, spot‑collect at night, or set up traps. |
