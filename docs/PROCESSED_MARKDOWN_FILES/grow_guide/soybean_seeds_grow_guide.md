## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Soybeans love *full sun* – pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs to be *well‑drained* and rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, then dig or till to loosen the soil.  
  - Work in **aged animal manure or compost** to boost fertility.  
- **Weed control:** Keep the bed weed‑free *until* you plant.

## How to Sow Soybean Seeds

Soybean seeds are simple to handle – no soaking, stratification, or special treatment required.

1. **Direct sow**:  
   - Plant **20 mm deep** and **15 cm apart** within a row.  
   - Space rows **50 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep the soil *moist* but never *waterlogged* or *dry*.  
3. **Germination:**  
   - Expect **7–14 days** for sprouting.  
   - Ideal soil temperature: **25–30 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  
5. **Frost caution:** Soybeans are frost‑sensitive. **Never transplant or sow** until the danger of frost has passed.

## How to Grow Soybeans

### Watering

- Check soil moisture **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a little soil with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal risk.  
- More on watering: [link](#).

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
- **Boosting tips** (if needed):  
  - *Balanced* or *fruit & veg* fertilizer works well.  
  - **Slow‑release**: apply at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm** tall.  
  - **Liquid**: apply during flowering or fruiting, following the product’s rate and frequency.

## How to Harvest Soybeans

- **Timing:** Pods are ready in about **85 days**.  
- **Edibility:** Pods must be cooked or fermented; raw pods are inedible.  
- **Harvesting:** Cut pods with snips or scissors.  
- **Frequency:** Harvest regularly to encourage more pods.  
- **Storage:**  
  - *Short term:* Keep in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - *Long term:* Ferment or freeze the pods.

## Common Problems When Growing Soybeans

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fixes |
|---------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may leave honeydew attracting ants. | • Spray with a garden hose<br>• Use soap or alcohol spray<br>• Invite predatory insects |
| **Tough Pods** | Pods become hard if harvested too late. | Harvest when pods are firm yet still tender; early harvest encourages more pods |
| **Armyworms / Cutworms / Caterpillars** | Chew inside fruit, leaving small holes. | Hand‑pick at night, use netting or fruit bags, or spray with Dipel |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scabs; premature leaf/flower drop. | Water at soil level, discard fallen debris, practice crop rotation |
| **Cutworms** | Moth larvae in soil, 3–4 cm long, chew stems at night. | Hand‑pick at night, use cardboard collars |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level, remove affected leaves, avoid overcrowding, consider homemade milk spray or fungicide |
| **Frost Damage** | Leaves wilt, turn black. | Wait for frost to pass before planting; harvest before winter; prune damaged leaves |
| **Possums, Birds, Other Animals** | Can destroy a large portion of the harvest overnight. | Use netting or cages; try homemade sprays (garlic, fish oil, mustard) |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide or homemade spray |
| **Spider Mites** | Dry, wilted, or discoloured leaves; undersides feel sandpaper‑like. | Prune for airflow, spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulphur |
