- **Soil:**  
  - Choose a *well‑drained* spot.  
  - Enrich with plenty of **organic matter** (aged animal manure or compost).  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen the soil by digging, and keep the area weed‑free until planting.

## How to Sow Rosella Seeds

Rosella seeds are simple to start – no soaking or stratification needed.

1. **Containers:** Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots filled with a high‑quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sowing depth:** Drop seeds **10 mm** deep.  
3. **Moisture:** Keep the soil *moist* but never *wet* or *dry*.  
4. **Germination:** Expect 10–21 days at a soil temperature of **25–35 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting:** Move seedlings outdoors once they develop their first true leaves and reach **5–10 cm** tall.  
6. **Spacing:** Plant at **45 cm** between plants and **100 cm** between rows.

> **Caution:** Rosella is frost‑sensitive. *Never* transplant or sow outdoors until the danger of frost has passed.  
> **Optional:** In cooler climates, start indoors **6 weeks** before the last expected frost. Grow them in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Rosella

### Watering

- **When to water:** Check the soil 5 cm below the surface by scratching a bit with your finger. Water when it feels dry.  
- **Timing:** Water *deeply* in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid leaf wetness:** Keep water off the foliage to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil:** Usually no extra fertilizer is needed.  
- **Boosting growth:**  
  - *Slow‑release fertilizer:* Apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
  - *Liquid fertilizer:* Use at the recommended rate and frequency during fruiting or flowering.

## How to Harvest Rosella

- **Timing:** Harvesting begins around **180–200 days** after sowing.  

### Leaves

- Harvest *young, tender* leaves as needed.  
- Pinch or snip the outer leaves, leaving some on the plant for future growth.  
- Consume promptly or store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge for short‑term use.

### Calyxes (Fruit)

- Rosella produces two flushes of flowers and fruit.  
  - The first flush is small; harvesting encourages a larger second flush later in summer.  
- **When ready:** Calyxes are *shiny and plump*.  
- **Harvesting method:** Cut the whole fruit off with snips or scissors, separating it from the stem.  
- **Uses:**  
  - Fresh calyxes can make jams, jellies, or cordial.  
  - To dry, spread whole fruit on a wire rack or tray and dry in the sun or a food dehydrator.

## Common Problems When Growing Rosella

| Problem | Symptoms | Management |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose<br>• Use soap or alcohol spray<br>• Encourage predatory insects |
| **Armyworms, Cutworms & Other Caterpillars** | Inside fruit, leaving small holes. | • Monitor fruit closely<br>• Remove caterpillars by hand<br>• Use insect exclusion netting or fruit bags<br>• Spray with Dipel if necessary |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots on leaves that spread quickly; reduces yield but rarely fatal. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves<br>• Ensure good airflow between plants<br>• Remove affected leaves<br>• Spray with appropriate fungicide or homemade spray |
