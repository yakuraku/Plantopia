# How to Grow Strawberry Spinach Seeds

**Family:** Amaranthaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Chenopodium foliosum_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Plant in **full sun or part shade** – aim for at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Self‑seeding:** Strawberry spinach loves to *self‑seed*. If you don’t want it to take over, **deadhead** before seed drop or grow in containers.  
- **Soil:** Needs a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - *Weed* thoroughly, then **dig over** to loosen.  
  - Add **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a variety suited for pots.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Minimum **20 L** pot size is recommended.  
  - Container plants may need extra fertiliser during the season.

## How to Sow Strawberry Spinach Seeds

No pre‑treatment needed (no soaking or stratification).

1. **Seed‑raising**  
   - Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sowing**  
   - Drop seeds **3 mm deep**.  
3. **Moisture**  
   - Keep soil **moist but not soggy or dry**.  
4. **Germination**  
   - Should occur in **7–14 days** at a soil temperature of **18–22 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting**  
   - Move seedlings outdoors once they have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing**  
   - Plant at **100 cm intervals**.

> **Tip:** Strawberry spinach is *half hardy*. Mature plants tolerate light frosts, but seedlings need protection until established. **Never sow or transplant before the last frost date.**

## How to Grow Strawberry Spinach

- **Watering**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface; water when it feels dry.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilising**  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra fertiliser.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release** fertiliser at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - **Liquid** fertiliser during fruiting or flowering, following the product’s recommended rate and frequency.

## How to Harvest Strawberry Spinach

- **Timing:** Leaves are ready in about **50 days**.  
- **Leaves**  
  - Harvest when they’re large enough to eat.  
  - Pinch off outer leaves, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
  - Store short‑term in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
- **Berries**  
  - Pick when they turn **red**.  
  - Cut with snips or twist to detach.  
  - Harvest regularly to encourage more fruit.  
  - Best eaten fresh; for longer storage, **freeze**.
