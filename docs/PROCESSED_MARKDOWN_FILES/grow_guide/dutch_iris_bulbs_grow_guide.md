# How to Grow Dutch Iris Bulbs

**Family:** Iridaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Iris x hollandica_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Dutch irises thrive in **full sun to part shade**. Aim for at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **loose, well‑drained** mix enriched with organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, dig to at least a **spade’s depth** to loosen the soil, and incorporate **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - In heavy soils, adding organic matter lightens the ground, allowing roots to grow freely.  
  - Keep the planting area weed‑free until you plant.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Dutch irises can be grown in pots. Choose a variety rated for container use.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of at least **40 L** to accommodate mature plants.  
  - Container plants often need **extra fertiliser** during the growing season to maintain healthy growth.

## How to Plant Dutch Iris Bulbs

Plant bulbs **directly in their final position**—garden bed or container.

1. **Spacing & depth:**  
   - Place bulbs **10 cm apart** and **10 cm deep**.  
   - Point the **tip upward**.  
2. **Cover & water:**  
   - Backfill with soil and water well.  
3. **Moisture:**  
   - Keep soil **moist but not waterlogged** until shoots emerge.

## Growing Dutch Irises

### Watering

- Water when the soil feels **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the **early morning or late afternoon** to avoid leaf wetness, which can promote fungal diseases.

### Fertilising

- If the soil is well‑prepared, **no extra fertiliser** is usually needed—bulbs store the energy required for next year’s bloom.  
- In poorer soils or for an extra boost:  
  - **Slow‑release fertiliser** at the recommended rate when shoots first appear, **or**  
  - **Liquid fertiliser** at the recommended rate and frequency when shoots first appear.  
- After flowering, fertilise with **blood & bone** or **aged/pelletised chicken manure**, then water in well.

### Flowering

- Dutch irises typically flower in **60–90 days**.  
- For cut flowers, snip buds just as they start to unfurl. Use sharp snips or secateurs to cut the **longest stems possible**, remove lower leaves, and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.

### Deadheading & Foliage Care

- **Deadhead** regularly during the season to redirect energy to the bulb.  
- Use sharp tools to cut flowers or snap off dead ones.  
- Allow foliage to **die down naturally** after flowering; the bulb will absorb nutrients from the leaves for next season’s blooms.  
- Once all foliage has browned, trim individual leaves at ground level with sharp tools.

### Longevity & Mulching

- Dutch iris bulbs can stay in the ground for **several years** without lifting or dividing.  
- **Mulch heavily** to protect bulbs from extreme summer heat.  
- Lift bulbs only if you experience **wet summers**, overcrowding, or need to relocate them.

### Lifting & Storage

1. **Lift:** Use a garden fork to gently lift bulbs, avoiding damage.  
2. **Prune:** Remove any dead leaves still attached.  
3. **Store:** Keep bulbs in a **cool, dry space** on a wire rack or in a netting bag that allows airflow.  
   - Ideal storage temperature: **≈20 °C**.  
   - Avoid temperatures **>30 °C** to preserve viability.  
4. **Replant:** Bulbs can be replanted the following season in line with the planting chart above.

## Common Problems When Growing Dutch Iris

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | - Spray with a garden hose.<br>- Use soap or alcohol spray.<br>- Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Irregular brown spots that start wet then become dry, scab‑like; premature leaf and flower drop. | - Water at soil level, not on leaves.<br>- Dispose of fallen leaves and fruit.<br>- Practice crop rotation. |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._) | Brown to orange raised spots or patches on foliage; spread by wind or water, especially at 10–20 °C and high humidity. | - Space plants to avoid overcrowding.<br>- Provide recommended light (full sun).<br>- Avoid over‑fertilising.<br>- Remove dead plants and rotate crops. |
| **Grey Mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Mouldy flowers and rotting fruit; spores spread by wind, survive in soil or green waste; thrives in cool, damp weather. | - Prune affected flowers and fruit.<br>- Water at soil level.<br>- Use appropriate fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Rotten Bulbs/Corms** | Bulbs show rot, lack roots or shoots, or produce stunted yellow leaves. | - Plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers.<br>- Do not water while dormant.<br>- Lift and store bulbs if climate requires. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves and shoots, mainly at night; leave slimy trails. | - Remove hiding places.<br>- Keep free‑range poultry.<br>- Collect by torchlight or use traps. |
