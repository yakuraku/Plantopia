## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Viola thrives in **full sun or part shade**. Aim for at least **3 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, then dig or till to loosen the soil.  
  - Add **aged animal manure or compost** to boost fertility.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, choose a variety labeled **“container‑friendly.”**  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot of at least **10 L** (≈ 2.5 gal).  
  - Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season to stay healthy.

## How to Sow Viola Seeds

Viola seeds are simple to handle—no soaking or stratification required.

1. **Seed‑raising mix**  
   - Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Planting depth**  
   - Sow seeds **6 mm** deep.  
3. **Cover & Light**  
   - Cover seeds with soil to keep them **light‑free**.  
   - If you prefer, place a board or black plastic over the tray and remove it once seedlings emerge.  
4. **Moisture**  
   - Keep the soil **moist but not soggy**—never let it dry out or become waterlogged.  
5. **Germination**  
   - Seeds sprout in **4–7 days** at a soil temperature of **17–21 °C**.  
6. **Transplanting**  
   - Move seedlings outdoors once they develop their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
   - Space plants **15–30 cm** apart for optimal growth.

## How to Grow Viola

- **Watering**  
  - Maintain **evenly moist** soil; avoid letting it dry out.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - **Skip the leaves** to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilising**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, you may skip extra fertiliser.  
  - For poorer soils or a growth boost:  
    - *Slow‑release* fertiliser at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - *Liquid* fertiliser during flowering or fruiting, following the product’s recommended rate and frequency.  
- **Bloom Time**  
  - Expect flowers to appear in **110–120 days**.  
- **Deadheading**  
  - Regularly trim faded or dead flowers **just above a leaf pair** using sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - This encourages continuous blooming.

## Common Problems When Growing Violas

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scab‑like patches; leaves and flowers may drop early. | Water at soil level only, discard fallen debris, practice crop rotation. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level, remove and destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding to improve airflow. If persistent, try a homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Grey Mould (Botrytis)** | Mouldy flowers and rotting fruit; spores spread by wind, thrive in cool, damp weather. | Prune affected parts, water at soil level, apply appropriate fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White powdery spots that spread across leaves; reduces yield but rarely fatal. | Water at soil level, ensure good airflow, remove affected leaves, apply fungicide or homemade spray if necessary. |
