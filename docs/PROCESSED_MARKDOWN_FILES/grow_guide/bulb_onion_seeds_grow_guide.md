# How to Grow Bulb Onion Seeds

**Family:** Amaryllidaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Allium sp._  
**Life Cycle:** biennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Choose a spot that gets **at least 6 h of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, dig it up to loosen, and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Tip:* A light layer of mulch after planting helps retain moisture and suppress weeds.

## How to Sow Onion Seeds

Onion seeds are tiny but mighty—no pre‑treatment needed. You can sow them straight in the garden or start them indoors and transplant later.

### 1. Sow Directly

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | **Plant** seeds **5 mm deep** and **5–10 cm apart** in rows **25–40 cm apart**. |
| 2 | **Moisture**: Keep soil consistently damp—never soggy or dry. |
| 3 | **Germination**: Seeds sprout in **7–14 days** when soil is **20–25 °C**. |
| 4 | **Protection**: Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raise Seedlings Indoors

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **high‑quality seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | **Plant** seeds **5 mm deep**. |
| 3 | **Moisture**: Keep soil damp but not waterlogged. |
| 4 | **Germination**: Expect **7–14 days** at **20–25 °C**. |
| 5 | **Transplant** when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | **Spacing**: Plant out at **5–10 cm apart** with rows **25–40 cm apart**. |

> **Tip:** Because onion seeds are so small, mix them with a little sand or fine potting mix before sowing, or use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly. Press lightly into the soil surface to ensure good seed‑soil contact.

## How to Grow Onion

- **Watering:**  
  - Check moisture **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil was well‑prepared, no extra fertilizer is needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - *Slow‑release*: Apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - *Liquid*: Follow the label during fruiting or flowering.  
- **Thinning:** Once seedlings are large enough to handle, pull out weak or small ones so that plants are spaced **5–10 cm apart**.

## How to Harvest Onions

- **Harvest window:** **60–230 days** after sowing, depending on variety and conditions.  
- **Bulb harvest (for storage):**  
  1. Wait until the leaves **fall over** and turn brown.  
  2. Use a fork to **lift** the plant, shake off excess soil.  
  3. **Cure** by placing whole plants on wire racks in a dry, cool area for **2–3 weeks**.  
  4. Cut off dried leaves **3–4 cm above** the bulb.  
  5. Store in a cool, dry place; for longer storage, consider freezing or pickling.  
- **Spring onions:** Harvest when stems swell or bulbs are still small. Lift gently, shake off soil, and store in the fridge for short‑term use.

## Common Problems When Growing Onions

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Tiny (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may leave honeydew attracting ants. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage natural predators (ladybugs, lacewings). |
| **Bulbs Not Forming** | Small or misshapen bulbs, early harvest, inconsistent watering, or too much nitrogen. | • Harvest at the right time (after leaves die down).<br>• Water consistently.<br>• Use varieties suited to your climate.<br>• Avoid over‑fertilizing with nitrogen. |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._) | Brown to orange raised spots or patches on leaves; spreads by wind or water. | • Space plants to avoid overcrowding.<br>• Provide full sun.<br>• Don’t over‑fertilize.<br>• Remove dead foliage and practice crop rotation. |
| **Onion Thrips** (_Thrips tabaci_) | Small (≤1.5 mm), pale yellow to light brown; leaves show silver patches. | • Wash with a garden hose.<br>• Mulch around plants.<br>• Encourage predatory mites and lacewings via companion planting. |
