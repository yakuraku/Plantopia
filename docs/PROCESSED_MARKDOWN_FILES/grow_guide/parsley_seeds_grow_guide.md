# How to Grow Parsley Seeds

**Family:** Apiaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Petroselinum spp._  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Parsley thrives in **full sun to part shade**. Aim for at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.
- **Soil:** Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  1. Thoroughly weed the area.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  3. Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  4. Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.

- **Containers:** Parsley can grow happily in pots.  
  - Choose a container recommended for container growing.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - **Minimum size:** 40 L (about 10 gal) to allow full development.  
  - Container plants may need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Parsley Seeds

Parsley seeds are **easy to handle**—no soaking or stratification required.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep** and **30–40 cm apart** in rows spaced **30 cm** apart. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but not soggy**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **14–28 days** at a soil temperature of **10–30 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain moist soil (never wet or dry). |
| 4 | Germination: **14–28 days** at **10–30 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Plant out, spacing **30–40 cm** apart, rows **30 cm** apart. |

> **Tip:** Parsley also does well with the *scatter seed* method—roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil.

> **Caution:** Parsley is a cool‑season crop. Avoid sowing or transplanting in very warm weather to prevent premature bolting.

## How to Grow Parsley

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil is dry **5 cm below the surface** (check by scratching a bit of soil).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  *Learn more about watering here.*

- **Fertilising:**  
  - If the soil was well prepared, extra fertiliser is usually unnecessary.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑nitrogen** or leafy‑green‑specific fertiliser:  
    - **Slow‑release:** Apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid:** Apply at the recommended rate and frequency during the growing season.

- **Thinning (Optional):**  
  - Once seedlings are large enough to handle, thin them to give each plant **30–40 cm** of space. Pull out weak or small seedlings.

- **Flower Removal:**  
  - To prolong the plant’s life, **remove flower stalks** as soon as they appear.

## How to Harvest Parsley

- **Timing:** Parsley is ready in **100–130 days**.
- **Method:** Pinch off outer leaves, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.
- **Use:** Consume fresh as soon as possible.
- **Storage:**  
  - Short‑term: Store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - Long‑term: Freeze whole leaves or chop and freeze in ice‑cube trays.

## Common Problems When Growing Parsley

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Prevention & Management |
|---------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed production. | Avoid sowing until after frost danger or in very hot weather. Keep plants well‑watered and deeply during heat to reduce stress. |
| **Carrot Fly** (_Psila rosa_) | Eggs laid on seedlings; larvae burrow into roots. | Use companion plants or insect‑exclusion netting over crops. |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insects on leaf undersides; yellowing or wilting leaves; slowed growth. | Rinse with a garden hose or spray with soap solution. Destroy severely affected plants. Encourage beneficial predators. *Read more about managing whitefly here.* |
