# How to Grow Chilli Seeds

**Family:** *Solanaceae*  
**Binomial name:** *Capsicum spp.*  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Chilli plants thrive in **full sun** – aim for at least **6 h of direct light** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Choose a **well‑drained** bed enriched with plenty of organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, dig in to loosen, then mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, pick a variety suited to container life.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of **≥20 L** for mature plants.  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Chilli Seeds

Chilli seeds are *easy to start* – no soaking or stratification required.

### 1. Sow Directly in the Garden

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Plant seeds **5 mm deep** and **40–60 cm apart**; rows **60–100 cm** apart. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but never waterlogged**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–21 days** at **22–35 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raise Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **good seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist but not soggy** soil. |
| 4 | Germinate in **7–21 days** at **22–35 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **40–60 cm** apart, rows **60–100 cm** apart. |

> **Tip:** Chillies are frost‑sensitive. **Never plant outdoors** until the danger of frost has passed.  
> In cooler climates, start seeds indoors **6 weeks before the last expected frost** in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Chilli

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil is **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If soil is already well‑prepared, extra fertilizer isn’t usually needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid** fertilizer during fruiting or flowering, following the recommended rate and frequency.  
- **Support:**  
  - Chillies grow tall and heavy.  
  - Use a sturdy stake, trellis, or tripod.  
  - Tie stems gently with twine or plant ties as they grow.  
  - Set up support **before sowing** to avoid disturbing roots later.  
- **Growth Habit:**  
  - In tropical/subtropical zones, chillies can be **year‑round**.  
  - In temperate/cool areas, treat them as **warm‑season annuals**.  
  - To keep them as perennials in cooler climates, grow in a sheltered spot, protect from frost, or overwinter by potting up and pruning hard in early winter.

## How to Harvest Chillies

- **Timing:** Fruits are ready in **60–100 days**.  
- **Readiness:** Look for a **firm, glossy skin**; you can harvest before or after color change.  
- **Method:** Cut with snips or secateurs, leaving **≈3 cm of stem**.  
- **Frequency:** Harvest regularly to encourage more fruit.  
- **Storage:**  
  - **Room temperature** for short term.  
  - **Refrigerator** to extend life.  
  - **Dry, freeze, or preserve in oil** for long‑term storage.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap/alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Queensland Fruit Fly** | Eggs in fruit → internal rot; fruit falls early; larvae visible when cut open. | Dispose of fallen fruit, use insect netting, install traps. |
| **Whitefly** | Large numbers on leaf undersides; yellowing or wilting leaves; growth slows. | Hose spray, soap spray, attract beneficial insects. |
| **Blossom End Rot** | Dark, hard discoloration from fruit bottom upward. | Regular, even watering; correct soil pH and nutrients. |
| **Sunscald** | White marks or blisters on fruit, often molderly. | Avoid pruning leaves during peak summer; shade with light fabric on hot days. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots spreading across leaves. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide if needed. |
| **Birds, Possums, etc.** | Large harvest loss overnight. | Netting or cages; homemade sprays (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium Wilt** | Root‑borne fungi → wilting, yellowing, death. | Choose resistant varieties, remove infected plants, practice crop rotation. |
| **Cutworms** | Moth larvae chewing stems at night. | Hand removal at night, cardboard collars around stems. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Brown, scab‑like spots that dry. | Water at soil level, remove fallen debris, crop rotation. |

> **Pro Tip:** Keep a **garden journal**—note dates of sowing, transplanting, fertilizing, and any pest sightings. This helps spot patterns and fine‑tune your care routine.

Enjoy the heat and flavor that home‑grown chillies bring to your kitchen!
