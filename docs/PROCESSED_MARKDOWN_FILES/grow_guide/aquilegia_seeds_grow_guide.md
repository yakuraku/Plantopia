# How to Grow Aquilegia Seeds  

**Family:** Ranunculaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Aquilegia viridiflora_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation  

Aquilegia are **short‑lived perennials**—they usually thrive for 2–5 years.  
- **Pick a permanent spot** where the plants won’t be disturbed by digging or foot traffic.  
- They love **full sun or part shade**; aim for at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  

### Soil  
- Needs a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
- Start by **weeding** thoroughly, then **dig over** to loosen the soil.  
- Add **aged animal manure or compost** to boost fertility.  
- Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.

### Containers  
- Aquilegia can grow happily in pots.  
- Choose a **container‑friendly variety** if you’re container‑growing.  
- Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of at least **10 L** to give roots room to grow.  
- During the growing season, **extra fertilizer** may help container plants stay healthy.  

## How to Sow Aquilegia Seeds  

1. **No pre‑treatment needed**—just sow straight away.  
2. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets).  
3. **Plant seeds 3 mm deep**.  
4. Keep the soil **moist but never soggy or dry**.  
5. Germination takes **21–28 days** at a soil temperature of **20–25 °C**.  
6. **Transplant** seedlings once they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
7. When planting out, space the plants **40 cm apart**.  

> **Tip:** This variety can be slow to germinate. Patience and strict adherence to depth and temperature guidelines give you the best chance of success.  

## How to Grow Aquilegia  

- **Water regularly** during the growing season.  
  - Keep soil **evenly moist** but avoid waterlogging.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - **Skip the leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  

- **Fertilizing**  
  - If the soil is well‑prepared, no extra fertilizer is usually needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flowering‑plant** fertilizer:  
    - *Slow‑release*: apply at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - *Liquid*: apply during fruiting or flowering at the recommended rate and frequency.  

- **Flowering**  
  - Aquilegia typically bloom after **≈200 days**.  
  - **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading or dead flowers just above a set of leaves with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - After flowering, **prune** back to tidy the plant and encourage vigorous new growth. Cut stems just above lower leaves.  

## Common Problems When Growing Aquilegia  

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Handle It |
|---------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Armyworms, Cutworms & Other Caterpillars** | Buds or flowers eaten; young caterpillars burrow into buds, preventing proper opening or destroying seeds. | Monitor and remove caterpillars by hand; use insect‑exclusion netting or spray with Dipel if needed. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow to grey‑brown patches on leaves, especially undersides. | Water at soil level (not on leaves); remove and destroy affected leaves; avoid overcrowding to improve airflow. If persistent, try a homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread to cover leaves; reduces yield but rarely fatal. | Water at soil level; ensure good airflow; remove affected leaves; spray with suitable fungicide or homemade spray if necessary. *Read more about powdery mildew here.* |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that feed on tender leaves and shoots, leaving slimy trails, mainly at night. | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, collect by torchlight, or set traps. *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
