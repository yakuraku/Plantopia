# How to Grow Russian Tarragon Seeds

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** *Artemisia dracunculus*  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Plant in **full sun or part shade** – aim for at least **3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Location:** Choose a **permanent spot**; tarragon is a perennial that thrives when left undisturbed.  
- **Soil:** Needs **well‑drained, organic‑rich soil**.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area.  
  - Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Use a variety labeled for container growing.  
  - Fill with a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Minimum pot size: **20 L** (about 5 gal).  
  - Container plants may need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Russian Tarragon Seeds

Russian tarragon seeds **don’t need pre‑treatment** (no soaking or stratification).

1. **Seed‑raising mix**: Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sowing depth**: Drop seeds **1 mm deep**.  
3. **Moisture**: Keep soil **moist but not waterlogged**.  
4. **Germination**:  
   - Expect **10–14 days** at a soil temperature of **15–20 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting**:  
   - Move seedlings once they develop their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
   - Space plants **50 cm apart** in the garden.  
6. **Hardiness**:  
   - Russian tarragon is **half‑hardy**; seedlings need protection from frost.  
   - **Do not transplant or sow outdoors** until after the last frost.  
   - *Optional*: In cooler climates, start seeds indoors **6 weeks before** the last expected frost in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Russian Tarragon

- **Watering**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- **Fertilising**  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually suffices.  
  - For poorer soil or a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertiliser** at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - **Liquid fertiliser** during the growing season, following the product’s recommended rate and frequency.  
- **Pruning**  
  - After flowering, trim back to tidy the plant and stimulate new growth.  
  - Use sharp secateurs or snips; cut stems just above a set of lower leaves.

## How to Harvest Russian Tarragon

- **Harvest window**: **90–100 days** after sowing.  
- **Method**: Pinch off outer stems and leaves, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
- **Storage**  
  - Short‑term: Place stems in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - Long‑term: Dry the stems for later use.

## Common Problems When Growing Russian Tarragon

| Problem | Description | Management Tips |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._) | Brown‑to‑orange raised spots or patches on foliage. Spreads by wind or water, especially at **10–20 °C** and high humidity. | - Space plants to avoid overcrowding.<br>- Provide **full sun**.<br>- Avoid over‑fertilising.<br>- Remove dead plant material.<br>- Practice crop rotation. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that nibble tender leaves and shoots at night, leaving slimy trails. | - Remove hiding places (e.g., debris, mulch).<br>- Keep free‑range poultry if possible.<br>- Use torchlight to spot them at night.<br>- Set up traps or barriers. |
