# How to Grow Coreopsis Seeds

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Coreopsis sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Annual or Perennial  

---

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Coreopsis loves *full sun* – pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Perennial varieties:** If you’re growing a perennial, plant it in a *permanent location* so it can grow undisturbed.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed the area, loosen the soil, and add **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a container‑friendly variety if you’re growing in pots.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot that holds at least **10 L**.  
  - Container plants often need extra fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Coreopsis Seeds

Coreopsis seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking or stratification needed. Light exposure can boost germination, so press the seeds onto damp soil and lightly cover with fine soil.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **1 mm deep** and **30–80 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist**—never soggy or dry. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–30 days** at **12–21 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **1 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist** soil, avoiding waterlogged or dry conditions. |
| 4 | Germinate in **7–30 days** at **12–21 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **30–80 cm apart** when planting out. |

> **Tip:** In cooler climates, start indoors **6 weeks before the last frost**. Keep them warm and well‑lit.

## How to Grow Coreopsis

- **Watering:**  
  - Once established, coreopsis is *drought tolerant*.  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings; check by scratching **10 cm** below the surface.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.  

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, no extra fertilizer is needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertilizer.  
    - *Slow‑release:* apply at transplanting or when seedlings are **5–10 cm tall**.  
    - *Liquid:* apply during flowering or fruiting as recommended.  

- **Pruning & Pinching:**  
  - Pinch off the top set of leaves (just above a lower leaf) to encourage **denser growth** and **stronger stems**.  
  - After flowering, prune back to tidy the plant and stimulate new growth.  

- **Bloom Time:** Coreopsis typically **flowers in ~70 days**.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Handle It |
|---------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap/alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scabs; leaves and flowers may drop early. | Water at soil level, discard fallen debris, practice crop rotation. |
| **Grey Mould (Botrytis)** | Mouldy flowers and rotting fruit; spores spread by wind, thrive in cool, damp weather. | Prune affected parts, water at soil level, apply fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; reduces yield but rarely fatal. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide or homemade spray if necessary. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves, leaving slimy trails, especially at night. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use traps, or torchlight collection. |

> **Pro Tip:** Regularly inspect your plants; early detection keeps problems manageable.
