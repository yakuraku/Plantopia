# How to Grow Dragon Fruit Cuttings

**Family:** Cactaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Selenicereus sp._  
**Life Cycle:** perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Dragon fruit loves *full sun* – aim for at least **6 h** of direct light each day.  
- **Permanent spot:** Since they’re perennial, choose a location that won’t be disturbed by digging or heavy foot traffic.  
- **Frost sensitivity:** In cooler climates, grow them in **containers** and place them in a warm, sheltered spot (e.g., against a north‑facing wall).  
- **Pollination:**  
  - *Self‑fertile* varieties can do it alone.  
  - *Self‑sterile* varieties need a partner. Plant **3–4 different varieties** around a single post or trellis so they can cross‑pollinate.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs **excellent drainage** and high organic matter.  
  - Work in **compost** or well‑rotted manure before planting.  
  - Weed thoroughly and loosen the soil; keep the area weed‑free until you plant.  
- **Container growing:**  
  - Pick a variety suited for pots.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a container of at least **75 L** for mature plants.  
  - Container plants may need extra fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Plant Dragon Fruit Cuttings

1. **Start small:** Use a 14–20 cm pot filled with good potting mix or mushroom compost.  
2. **Plant depth:** Insert the cutting **2–3 cm** deep.  
3. **Orientation:** The arrow on the cutting should point **toward the sky**.  
4. **Support:** Place a bamboo cane or thin stake so the cutting stays upright.  
5. **Tie it up:** Secure with grafting tape or a soft plant tie.  
6. **Watering:** Water well, then only when the soil has dried out.  
7. **Transplant:** Move the cutting to its permanent spot **once roots form** and new growth appears.  

> **Tip:** Harden off cuttings before transplanting to avoid sunburn. Don’t transplant until after the last frost.

## How to Grow Dragon Fruit

- **Watering:**  
  - Once established, they’re drought tolerant.  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings; test by scratching 10 cm below the surface.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is already rich, skip extra fertilizer.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - *Slow‑release* fertilizer at transplant or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
    - *Liquid* fertilizer during fruiting/flowering.  
  - **Epsom salts** (magnesium sulphate) help flowering and keep leaves green.  
  - Once established, feed aerial roots with a foliar spray every **2 weeks** during the growing season.  
- **Support structure:**  
  - Use a **strong post or trellis** (15–20 cm diameter, 1.5–2 m tall).  
  - Install the support **before** transplanting to avoid root disturbance.  
  - Alternatively, train along a sturdy fence.  
  - Gently tie stems with grafting tape or soft ties; remove side shoots once the plant reaches the top.  
- **Pruning:**  
  - Trim after fruiting to tidy the plant and control size.

## How to Harvest Dragon Fruit

- **Timing:** Fruit is ready in **1–3 years**.  
- **Signs of ripeness:**  
  - Skin has fully colored.  
  - Fruit feels slightly soft to the touch and wobbles when moved.  
  - Ripe fruit can stay on the plant for ~2 weeks if protected from birds, possums, etc.  
- **Special note:** Some yellow varieties have spines; brush them off with a soft brush before harvesting.  
- **Harvesting method:** Twist the fruit off or cut with clean, sharp secateurs/knife.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Short‑term: room temperature or fridge.  
  - Long‑term: cut flesh into cubes and freeze for smoothies or sorbet.  
  - Best enjoyed chilled.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Frost damage** | Wilting, blackened leaves | Wait for frost to pass; prune damaged leaves. |
| **Birds/possums** | Missing fruit | Use netting/cages or homemade deterrent spray (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Rust (Puccinia sp.)** | Brown/orange raised spots | Space plants, ensure full sun, avoid over‑fertilizing, remove dead tissue, rotate crops. |
| **Mealybugs (Pseudococcidae sp.)** | White, cotton‑like coating, honeydew | Wipe leaves, spray with soap/alcohol, attract predators. |
| **Queensland Fruit Fly (Bactrocera tryoni)** | Rotting fruit, larvae inside | Dispose of fallen fruit, use netting, install traps. |
| **Root rot** | Yellowing/wilted foliage, soft brown base | Reduce soil moisture, add organic matter, keep mulch away from stems. |
| **Scale** | Brown/grey/white bumps, honeydew | Brush off, soap spray, prune infested parts. |
| **Sunburn** | White/yellow patches, scabs | Harden seedlings, cover with light fabric on hot days. |

> **Pro tip:** Regularly inspect your plants for early signs of these issues; early action saves the crop!
