- **Soil:**  
  - Needs **well‑drained** soil rich in organic matter.  
  - Start by **weeding** thoroughly, then **dig over** to loosen.  
  - Add **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a variety suited for container growing.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Pick a pot of **at least 10 L** for mature plants.

## How to Sow Candytuft Seeds

Candytuft seeds require **no pre‑treatment** (no soaking or stratification).

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep** and **20 cm apart** in the garden. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist**—never water‑logged or dry. |
| 3 | Germination takes **16–20 days** at **18–30 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **good quality seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist** soil—avoid both wet and dry extremes. |
| 4 | Germination: **16–20 days** at **18–30 °C**. |

## How to Grow Candytuft

### Watering

- Water when the soil is **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (check by finger).  
- Aim for **deep, infrequent** watering in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilizing

- If the soil is already well‑prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is needed.  
- For poorer soils or a boost:
  - **Slow‑release fertilizer** (high‑potassium or flowering‑plant formula) at the **recommended rate** when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - **Liquid fertilizer** at the **recommended rate/frequency** during fruiting or flowering.

### Flowering & Deadheading

- Candytuft typically **flowers in 90–100 days**.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: use sharp secateurs or snips to cut fading or dead flowers **just above a set of leaves**.  
- Removing spent blooms encourages **more flowering**.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Irregular brown spots that dry into scab‑like patches; premature leaf/flower drop | Water at soil level (not on leaves), discard fallen debris, practice crop rotation |
| **Grey mould (Botrytis sp.)** | Mouldy flowers, rotting fruit; thrives in cool, damp weather | Prune affected parts, water at soil level, apply suitable fungicide or homemade spray if needed |
