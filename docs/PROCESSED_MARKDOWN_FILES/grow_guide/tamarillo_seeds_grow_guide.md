## Preparation

Tamarillo plants are short‑lived perennials, living **2–5 years**.  
- **Choose a permanent spot** where the plants won’t be disturbed by digging.  
- **Full sun** is essential: aim for **≥6 h of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Wind protection**: plant in a sheltered area to keep seedlings safe.  

### Soil Requirements  
- **Well‑drained, organic‑rich soil** is a must.  
- **Weed** thoroughly, then loosen the soil by digging or turning.  
- Add **aged animal manure or compost** to boost fertility.  
- Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- For more on soil prep, see [Preparing Soil for Planting](#).

## How to Sow Tamarillo Seeds

Tamarillo seeds are **easy to handle**—no soaking or stratification needed.  
You can **direct‑sow** in the garden or **raise seedlings** in trays before transplanting.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep** and **400 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but never soggy or dry**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–28 days** at **18–28 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **high‑quality seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist but not waterlogged** soil. |
| 4 | Germination: **7–28 days** at **18–28 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **400 cm apart** in the garden. |

> **Tip:** Tamarillo is a *half‑hardy* crop. Mature plants tolerate light frosts, but seedlings need protection. **Do not transplant or sow outdoors until after the last frost**.  
> In cooler climates, start seeds indoors **6 weeks before the expected last frost** in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Tamarillo

### Watering  
- Water when the soil is **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil).  
- **Deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering is best.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- For more on watering, see [Watering Guide](#).

### Fertilizing  
- If the soil was well‑prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is usually needed.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **balanced or fruit/veg‑specific fertilizer**:  
  - **Slow‑release**: apply at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - **Liquid**: apply during fruiting or flowering, following the recommended rate and frequency.

### Pruning & Training  
- **Pinch off the growing tip** when the plant reaches **~120 cm**.  
  - This encourages **multiple branches**, stabilizes the tree, and eases harvesting.  
- Tamarillo may die back in cold weather.  
  - **Cut back** to just above ground in late autumn, or prune dead foliage in spring when new growth appears.

## How to Harvest Tamarillo

- **Harvest time:** about **2 years** after planting.  
- Fruit is ready when it’s **fully coloured** (red, orange, or yellow, depending on variety).  
- **Harvest method:** cut with snips/sewing scissors or twist gently to detach.  
- **Regular harvesting** encourages more fruit.  
- **Short‑term storage:** keep in the fridge.  
- **Long‑term storage:** make preserves.

## Common Problems When Growing Tamarillo

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention & Management |
|---------|----------|------------------------|
| **Frost Damage** | Leaves wilt, turn black | • Wait until all frost danger has passed before planting seedlings. <br>• Harvest before winter. <br>• Prune damaged leaves to prevent rot. |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium Wilt** | Wilting, dry leaves, yellowing, eventual death | • Choose resistant varieties. <br>• Dispose of infected plants and soil. <br>• Practice good garden hygiene and crop rotation. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots spreading across leaves | • Water at soil level, not on leaves. <br>• Ensure good airflow between plants. <br>• Remove affected leaves. <br>• Use suitable fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Queensland Fruit Fly** *(Bactrocera tryoni)* | Eggs in fruit, premature fruit drop, larvae inside fruit | • Dispose of fallen fruit promptly. <br>• Use insect‑exclusion netting. <br>• Install traps to monitor populations. |
