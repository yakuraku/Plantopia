## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Catnip loves *full sun* – pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Location:** As a perennial, it thrives when left undisturbed. Choose a permanent spot that won’t be dug up regularly.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, loosen the soil, then mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.  
  - *Tip:* For more on soil prep, see the linked guide.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Catnip grows well in pots. Pick a variety labeled **“container‑friendly.”**  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot of **at least 10 L** (≈2.6 gal).  
  - Container plants often need extra fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Catnip Seeds

Catnip seeds are *easy*—no soaking or stratification required.

1. **Choose a growing medium**  
   - Seed‑raising mix, soil starter pellets, or a good quality potting soil.  
2. **Plant depth** – Sow seeds **5 mm** deep.  
3. **Moisture** – Keep the soil *moist* but never *wet* or *dry*.  
4. **Germination** – Expect 10–20 days at a soil temperature of **21–27 °C** (70–80 °F).  
5. **Transplant** – Move seedlings outdoors once they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm** tall.  
6. **Spacing** – Plant 60 cm (≈2 ft) apart.  

> **Optional:** In cooler regions, start indoors **6 weeks** before the last expected frost. Keep them in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## Growing Catnip

- **Watering**  
  - Check the soil 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water *deeply* in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
  - *More on watering:* see the linked article.  
- **Fertilizer** – Catnip is hardy and usually doesn’t need extra feed during the season.  
- **Deadheading** – Trim faded or dead flowers just above a set of leaves with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - Regular deadheading encourages more blooms.  
  - *More on deadheading:* see the guide.  
- **Pruning**  
  - After flowering, cut stems back to tidy the plant and stimulate new growth.  
  - In late autumn, cut back to just above ground level if the plant dies back in winter.  
  - In spring, prune away any dead foliage as new leaves appear.

## Common Problems & How to Handle Them

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Root Rot** | Slow establishment, yellowing or wilted leaves, soft brown tissue at stem base. | Remove and discard affected plants. Reduce soil moisture, add organic matter, and keep mulch away from stems. |
| **Spider Mites** | Dry, wilted or discolored leaves; undersides feel sandpapery. | Prune for airflow, spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulfur. |
| **Thrips** | Tiny (≤1.5 mm) black/beige/white insects; larvae leave small white or transparent marks on leaves and petals. | Wash with a garden hose, encourage predatory mites and lacewings, or spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insects similar to aphids; swarm in clouds when disturbed; yellowing or wilting leaves; stunted growth. | Hose them off, spray with soap, or destroy heavily infested plants. Attract beneficial predators. |
