- **Soil**:  
  - Needs **excellent drainage**; avoid heavy, water‑logged loam.  
  - No extra manure or fertilizer is usually required.  
  - *Weed out* the area, then loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers**:  
  - If you’re growing in pots, select a variety suited to container life.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of at least **10 L**.  
  - Container plants may need a bit more fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Sage Seeds

Sage seeds are simple to handle—no soaking or stratification needed.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | **Plant** seeds **5 mm deep** and **50 cm apart** in the garden. |
| 2 | Keep the soil **moist but never soggy**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–21 days** at **18–21 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **good seed‑raising mix** or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist but not wet** soil. |
| 4 | Germinate in **7–21 days** at **18–21 °C**. |

## How to Grow Sage

- **Watering**  
  - Sage is drought‑tolerant once established.  
  - Let the soil **dry out** between waterings; test by scratching 10 cm below the surface.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - **Avoid wetting the leaves** to prevent fungal issues.  

- **Fertilizing**  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra feed.  
  - In poorer soils or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertilizer** at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - **Liquid fertilizer** during fruiting or flowering, following the product’s rate and frequency.  

- **Pruning**  
  - After flowering, trim back to tidy the plant and stimulate vigorous new growth.  
  - Use sharp secateurs or snips to cut stems just above a set of lower leaves.

## How to Harvest Sage

- **Method**: Pinch off outer leaves, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
- **Storage**:

## Common Problems When Growing Sage

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Prevention & Fix |
|---------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Fusarium & Verticillium Wilt** | Wilting, dry, yellowing leaves; branches die back. | No cure—choose resistant varieties, discard infected plants, practice good hygiene, and rotate crops. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, and apply a suitable fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Slimy trails, tender leaf damage, especially at night. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use traps, or spot‑treat with safe slug control methods. |
