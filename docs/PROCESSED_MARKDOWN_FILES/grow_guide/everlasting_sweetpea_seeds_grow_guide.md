# How to Grow Everlasting Sweetpea Seeds

**Family:** Fabaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Lathyrus latifolius_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Plant in **full sun or part shade** – aim for at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Location:** Because everlasting sweetpeas are **perennials**, choose a **permanent spot** that won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs to be **well‑drained** and rich in **organic matter**.  
  - Thoroughly **weed** the area, then **dig** to loosen the soil.  
  - Add **aged animal manure** or **compost** to boost fertility.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **pH (Optional):** Sweetpeas prefer **alkaline soil** (pH ≥ 7).  
  - If your soil is acidic, apply **dolomite** (calcium‑magnesium carbonate) or **garden lime** (calcium carbonate) at the recommended rate.  
  - Water well after liming to raise the pH.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Sweetpeas can thrive in pots.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a **container ≥ 40 L** for mature plants.  
  - Container plants may need **extra fertiliser** during the growing season.

## How to Sow Everlasting Sweetpea Seeds

### Seed Treatment (Optional)

- **Soaking:** Place seeds in room‑temperature water for **24 h**; they should swell noticeably.  
- **Scarifying:** Use a sharp knife to nick each seed’s shell, or gently file away a section of the husk with fine sandpaper or a nail file.  
  *These steps can speed up germination.*

### Direct Sowing

1. **Depth & Spacing:** Sow seeds **25 mm deep** and **15 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
3. **Germination Time:** Expect **14–30 days** at a soil temperature of **18–20 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raising Seedlings

1. **Containers:** Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sowing:** Plant seeds **25 mm deep**.  
3. **Moisture:** Same as direct sowing—moist but not soggy.  
4. **Germination:** **14–30 days** at **18–20 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting:** Move seedlings when they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing:** Plant out at **15 cm apart**.

## Growing Everlasting Sweetpeas

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil is **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil).  
  - Water **deeply** in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilising:**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, no extra fertiliser is needed.  
  - For poorer soil or a nutrient boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertiliser** (high‑potassium or flowering‑plant formula) at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid fertiliser** at the recommended rate/frequency during fruiting or flowering.  
- **Support:** Sweetpeas need a **trellis or sturdy support**.  
  - Tie plants gently with twine or plant ties.  
  - Set up the support **before sowing** to avoid disturbing roots later.  
- **Pinching (Optional):**  
  - Pinch off the top set of leaves just above a lower leaf set to encourage **denser growth, stronger stems, and more flowers**.  
  - Use sharp secateurs or snips.  
- **Flowering Time:** Expect blooms in **195–210 days**.  
- **Cut Flowers:**  
  - Cut the longest stems with sharp snips, remove lower leaves, and place immediately in a clean bucket of water.  
- **Deadheading:**  
  - Regularly trim fading or dead flowers just above a leaf set to promote more blooms.  
- **Winter Care:**  
  - Sweetpeas may die back in cold weather.  
  - Cut back to just above ground level in late autumn, or prune dead foliage when new leaves appear in spring.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Damping Off** | Seeds fail to germinate or seedlings rot at the base, becoming soft and mushy. | Use fresh potting mix, avoid overwatering, keep foliage dry, and ensure good drainage. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level only, remove and destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding, consider a homemade milk spray or fungicide if needed. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Tender leaves and shoots eaten at night, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, use free‑range poultry, collect by torchlight, or set traps. |
