## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot** – Lemon balm spreads quickly once established. Pick a garden bed or grow in containers to keep it from invading unwanted areas.  
- **Self‑seeding alert** – The plant drops seeds at season’s end that can germinate next year. If you don’t want it to take over, **deadhead** before seed drop or keep it in pots.  
- **Sunlight** – Full sun or part shade works best. Aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil** – Needs well‑drained, organic‑rich earth.  
  1. Weed thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  3. Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  4. Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Container growing** – If you prefer pots, use a variety suited to containers.  
  - **Pot size:** Minimum **10 L** for mature plants.  
  - **Potting mix:** High‑quality, well‑draining.  
  - **Fertiliser:** Container plants often need extra feeding during the growing season.

## How to Grow Lemon Balm

- **Watering**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal risk.  

- **Fertilising**  
  - If the soil is already rich, skip extra fertiliser.  
  - For poorer soil or a quick boost:  
    - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - **Liquid** fertilizer during the growing season, following the product’s rate and frequency.  

- **Winter care**  
  - Lemon balm may die back in cold weather.  
  - **Cut back** to just above ground in late autumn, or prune dead foliage when new growth appears in spring.

## Common Problems When Growing Lemon Balm

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fixes |
|---------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves, leaving slimy trails, especially at night. | • Remove hiding spots.<br>• Keep free‑range poultry.<br>• Use torchlight to spot and collect.<br>• Set up traps. |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insects similar to aphids, often in large numbers on leaf undersides; can cause yellowing, wilting, and stunted growth. | • Hose spray or soap spray.<br>• Destroy severely affected plants.<br>• Attract beneficial insects that prey on whitefly. |
