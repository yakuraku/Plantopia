# How to Grow Tulip Bulbs  

**Family:** Liliaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Tulipa hybrida_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation  

Tulips thrive in **full sun to part shade**—aim for at least **3 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  

- **Soil**: Loose, well‑drained, enriched with organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly.  
  - Dig to a spade’s depth to aerate.  
  - Mix in aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Heavy soils can be lightened this way, giving roots room to grow.  
- Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Container growing**:  
  - Choose a bulb‑suitable variety.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Pick a pot **≥10 L** (about 2.5 gal).  
  - Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the season.  

## How to Plant Tulip Bulbs  

Tulips are **cold‑climate bulbs** that require a winter chill to flower. In frost‑free areas, give them a 6‑8 week chill in the fridge (open paper bag, away from fruit).  

1. **Spacing**: Plant bulbs **20 cm apart**.  
2. **Depth**: Dig 15‑20 cm deep; point the tip upward.  
3. **Cover**: Fill with soil and water well.  
4. **Moisture**: Keep soil damp (but not soggy) until shoots appear.  

## How to Grow Tulips  

- **Watering**:  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface; water when dry.  
  - Water early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilising**:  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually needs none.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - *Slow‑release* fertilizer at recommended rate when shoots emerge, **or**  
    - *Liquid* fertilizer at recommended rate and frequency when shoots emerge.  
  - After flowering, feed with blood‑and‑bone, aged or pelletised chicken manure and water well.  
- **Bloom Time**: Expect flowers in **60‑90 days**.  

## Managing Flowers  

- **Deadhead**:  
  - Use sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - Cut flowers for picking with the longest stems, or snap off dead blooms.  
  - Regular removal redirects energy back to the bulb.  
- **Foliage**:  
  - Let leaves die naturally after flowering; the bulb reabsorbs nutrients.  
  - When all leaves have browned, trim them to ground level with sharp tools.  

## Bulb Care After Season  

- **Container & Warm‑Climate Bulbs**:  
  - Treat as annuals; discard after flowering.  
- **Cool, Frost‑Free Climates**:  
  - Lift bulbs, chill, then replant for repeat flowering.  
- **Cold, Frosty Climates**:  
  - Leave in ground to naturalise; lift only when moving or overcrowded.  

**Lifting Tips**  
- Use a garden fork; avoid damaging bulbs.  
- Prune any dead leaves still attached.  
- Store in a cool, dry place on a wire rack or netted bag.  
- Ideal storage temperature: **≈20 °C**; avoid >30 °C.  
- Replant next season following the planting chart.  

## Common Problems When Growing Tulips  

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2‑4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew attracting ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Grey Mould (Botrytis)** | Mouldy flowers and rotting fruit, especially in cool, damp weather. | Prune affected parts, water at soil level (not on leaves), and apply a suitable fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Rotten Bulbs/Corms** | Bulbs show rot, lack roots or shoots, or produce stunted yellow leaves without flowers. | Plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers; avoid watering during dormancy; lift and store if climate requires. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves and shoots, leaving slimy trails, mainly at night. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use traps, or spot‑treat with slug‑baits. |
| **Thrips** | Tiny (≤1.5 mm) flying insects; larvae leave small white or transparent marks on leaves and petals. | Wash plants with a garden hose, encourage predatory mites and lacewings, or spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |
