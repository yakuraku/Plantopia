# How to Grow Chrysanthemum Seeds

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** *Chrysanthemum sp.*  
**Life Cycle:** Annual or Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Choose the right spot**  
  - *Perennial varieties* need a permanent location that won’t be disturbed by digging.  
  - *Annuals* can be planted anywhere that meets the light and soil requirements.

- **Light**  
  - Chrysanthemums thrive in **full sun** or **part shade**.  
  - Aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.

- **Soil**  
  - Needs to be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Work in **aged animal manure** or **compost** after thorough weeding and loosening.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

- **Containers**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, pick a variety suited for container life.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of **at least 10 L**.  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Chrysanthemum Seeds

Chrysanthemum seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking or stratification required. You can sow them straight into the garden or start them indoors and transplant later.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **1 mm deep** and **20–40 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but not soggy**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **10–14 days** at **20–22 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **1 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist but not wet** soil. |
| 4 | Germinate in **10–14 days** at **20–22 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **20–40 cm apart** when planting out. |

**Tip:** For a quick start, try the *scatter seed* method—roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil.

**Optional:** In cooler climates, start seeds indoors **6 weeks before the last frost**. Keep them in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Chrysanthemums

- **Watering**  
  - Check soil **5 cm below the surface**; water when it’s dry.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk.

- **Fertilizing**  
  - If soil is already well‑prepared, you may skip extra fertilizer.  
  - For a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid** fertilizer during flowering or fruiting, following the recommended rate.

- **Thinning**  
  - Once seedlings are sturdy, thin out weak ones so plants are **20–40 cm apart**.

- **Pruning for Bushiness**  
  - Pinch off the outermost set of leaves on each branch with your fingertips to encourage branching.

- **Flowering Time**  
  - Expect blooms in **80–100 days**.

- **Deadheading**  
  - Trim fading or dead flowers just above a leaf set with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - Regular deadheading promotes more blooms.

- **Cut Flowers**  
  - Use sharp tools to cut the longest stems, remove lower leaves, and place stems in clean water immediately.

- **Perennial Care**  
  - After flowering, prune back to tidy the plant and stimulate strong new growth.  
  - Cut stems just above a lower leaf set with sharp tools.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with water, use soap/alcohol spray, or attract predators. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Brown, wet‑looking spots that dry into scabs; premature leaf/flower drop. | Water at soil level, remove fallen debris, practice crop rotation. |
| **Grey Mould (Botrytis)** | Mouldy flowers/fruit, especially in cool, damp weather. | Prune affected parts, water at soil level, consider fungicide if needed. |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium Wilt** | Wilting, yellowing leaves; roots block water/nutrient flow. | No cure—use resistant varieties, remove infected plants, rotate crops. |
| **Rust (Puccinia)** | Brown/orange raised spots on foliage. | Space plants, ensure full sun, avoid over‑fertilizing, rotate crops. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide if necessary. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Slimy trails, tender leaf damage at night. | Remove hiding spots, use poultry, traps, or torchlight collection. |
| **Spider Mites** | Dry, wilted or discoloured leaves; fine sandpaper feel on undersides. | Prune for airflow, spray eco‑oil or wettable sulphur. |
