# How to Grow Couve Tronchuda Seeds

**Family:** Brassicaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Brassica oleracea_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Plant in a spot that gets **at least 6 h of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:** Needs a well‑drained mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area.  
  - Loosen the soil by digging or turning.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
- Keep the bed weed‑free until you sow.

> *Tip:* A healthy, loamy base reduces the need for extra fertiliser later.

## How to Sow Couve Tronchuda Seeds

Couve tronchuda seeds are *ready to plant straight away*—no soaking or stratification required.  
You can sow them directly in the garden or start seedlings in trays and transplant later.

### Sow Direct

1. **Depth & spacing:** Plant seeds **8 mm deep**.  
   - Space plants **80 cm apart**.  
   - Keep rows **100 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
3. **Germination:** Seeds sprout in **3–7 days** at **8–30 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raise Seedlings

1. **Containers:** Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sowing:** Plant seeds **8 mm deep**.  
3. **Moisture:** Same rule—keep soil moist but not soggy.  
4. **Germination:** 3–7 days at **8–30 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting:** Move seedlings when they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing:** Plant out at **80 cm apart** with rows **100 cm apart**.

> *Remember:* Couve tronchuda is a cool‑season crop. Avoid sowing or transplanting in very hot weather to prevent premature bolting.

## Growing

### Watering

- **When to water:** Check the soil 5 cm below the surface—if it feels dry, it’s time.  
- **Method:** Water deeply in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
- **Avoid leaf wetness:** Keep water off the foliage to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising

- **If soil is well‑prepared:** No extra fertiliser is usually needed.  
- **For poorer soils or a nutrient boost:**  
  - **Slow‑release fertiliser:** Apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - **Liquid fertiliser:** Use as directed throughout the growing season.

## Harvesting

- **Timeframe:** Leaves are ready in **80–90 days**.  
- **Method:** Cut the outer leaves at the base, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
- **Storage:**  
  - *Short term:* Store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - *Long term:* Chop, blanch, then freeze.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Cabbage moth / cabbage white butterfly** | White/grey wings, eggs on leaf undersides; caterpillars create holes or skeletonise leaves. | Use netting or decoys; hand‑pick caterpillars; targeted sprays if needed. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed production. | Avoid sowing until after frost danger; keep plants well‑watered in hot weather. |
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots/undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, soap or alcohol spray; encourage natural predators. |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves. | Water at soil level, not on leaves; improve airflow; remove affected leaves; use fungicide or homemade spray if necessary. |
| **Possums, birds, other animals** | Rapid loss of foliage overnight. | Netting or cages; homemade deterrents (garlic, fish oil, mustard spray). |
| **Cutworms** | White, grey, or brown larvae (3–4 cm) that chew stems at night. | Hand‑pick at night; use cardboard collars around seedlings. |

> *Pro tip:* Regular scouting and early intervention keep these pests from taking over.
