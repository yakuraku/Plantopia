# How to Grow Chickpea Seeds

**Family:** Fabaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Cicer arietinum_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Chickpeas thrive in *full sun*—pick a spot that gets at least **6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Soil:** Use a *well‑drained* mix rich in organic matter.  
  1. Weed the area thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging or turning it.  
  3. Work in aged animal manure or compost.  
  4. Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Crop rotation:** Rotate crops to keep pests and diseases at bay.  
  - After leaf crops, plant carrots.  
  - Follow carrots with fruit crops for better yields.

## How to Sow Chickpea Seeds

Chickpeas are *easy to start*—no soaking or stratification needed. You can sow them directly in the garden or raise seedlings first.

### Sow Directly

1. **Depth & spacing:** Plant seeds **20 mm** deep, **20 cm** apart, with rows **60 cm** apart.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil consistently moist—never waterlogged or dry.  
3. **Germination:** Seeds sprout in **7–30 days** when soil is **10–15 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raise Seedlings First

1. **Containers:** Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a high‑quality seed‑raising mix (or soil starter pellets).  
2. **Planting:** Sow seeds **20 mm** deep.  
3. **Moisture:** Same rule—keep soil moist but not soggy.  
4. **Germination:** 7–30 days at **10–15 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting:** Move seedlings when they develop their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm** tall.  
6. **Spacing:** Plant out **20 cm** apart, rows **60 cm** apart.

> *Note:* Chickpeas are hardy, but frost can cause flowers and pods to drop.  

> **Patience is key:** Some varieties take longer to germinate—stick to the depth and temperature guidelines for best results.

## How to Grow Chickpeas

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil feels dry **5 cm** below the surface (check by scratching a bit of soil).  
  - Water *deeply* in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk.  

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If soil is well‑prepared, no extra fertilizer is needed.  
  - In poorer soils or for a boost:  
    - *Slow‑release fertilizer* at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - *Liquid fertilizer* during flowering or fruiting, following the recommended rate and frequency.

## How to Harvest Chickpeas

- **Timing:** Pods are ready in about **100 days**.  
- **Fresh pods:**  
  - Harvest when pods are large enough to eat.  
  - Cut with snips or secateurs.  
  - Harvest regularly to encourage more pods.  
  - Store short‑term in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
- **Drying for storage:**  
  - Harvest when leaves have browned and dried.  
  - Cut the whole plant, lay it on a wire rack to dry.  
  - Split pods as they dry, collect seeds.  
  - Store dried seeds in an airtight container; soak before use.

## Common Problems When Growing Chickpeas

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Grey mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Mouldy flowers, rotting fruit; spores spread by wind, survive in soil or green waste. | Prune affected parts, water at soil level (not leaves), apply fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow to grey‑brown patches on leaves, especially undersides. | Water at soil level, remove and destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding for airflow; use homemade milk spray or fungicide if problems persist. |
| **Spider mites** (Tetranychus urticae) | Dry, wilted or discolored leaves; undersides feel sandpaper‑like. | Prune for airflow, spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulphur. |
