## Preparation

- **Self‑seeding**: Orach tends to drop seeds onto the soil at season’s end. If you *don’t* want it to become a perennial, deadhead before seed drop or grow in containers.  
- **Sunlight**: Full sun or part shade works best. Aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil**:  
  - Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, dig over to loosen, then add aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers**:  
  - Choose a container‑friendly variety if possible.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Minimum size: **10 L** (≈2.6 gal).  
  - Container plants may need extra fertiliser during the season.

## How to Sow Orach Seeds

Orach seeds are *easy* to start—no soaking or stratification required.

1. **Direct sow**:  
   - 2 mm deep, 40 cm apart.  
   - Rows 50 cm apart.  
2. **Soil moisture**: Keep moist but **never** waterlogged or dry.  
3. **Germination**: 7–14 days at 20–22 °C.  
4. **Protection**: Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  

**Tip**: The “scatter seed” method works too—roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover.

## How to Grow Orach

### Watering

- Check soil 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilising

- **Well‑prepared soil**: Usually no extra fertiliser needed.  
- **Poor soil or extra boost**:  
  - *High‑nitrogen* or leafy‑green/herb‑specific fertiliser.  
  - **Slow‑release**: Apply at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
  - **Liquid**: Follow the label’s rate and frequency during the season.

### Thinning

- When seedlings are large enough, thin to **≈40 cm spacing**.  
- Pull out weak or small seedlings.

### Pinching

- Pinch the growing tips to promote denser foliage.  
- Use sharp secateurs or snips; cut just above a lower leaf set.

## How to Harvest Orach

| Stage | Time | What to Harvest | How |
|-------|------|-----------------|-----|
| **Leaves** | ~50 days | Spinach‑like leaves | Pinch off outer leaves, leave some on the plant. |
| | | Whole plant | Cut stems at ground level. |
| | | Storage | Keep in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge (short‑term). |
| **Seeds** | 75–100 days | Edible seeds | Let seed heads dry on the plant; hand‑pick seeds. |
| | | Uses | Grind into flour, add to soups, stews, bread, cereals. |
| | | Storage | Airtight container, dry, cool place. |
| **Cut Flowers** | Early season or when seed heads form | Long stems | Cut with sharp snips or secateurs; remove lower leaves; place stems in clean water immediately. |

## Common Problems When Growing Orach

| Problem | Symptoms | Management |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage predatory insects. |
