**Family:** Brassicaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Brassica oleracea gemmifera_  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Brussels sprouts thrive in **full sun**. Pick a spot that receives at least **6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Soil:** Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  1. Weed the area thoroughly.  
  2. Dig or till to loosen the soil.  
  3. Mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  4. Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.

## How to Sow Brussels Sprouts Seeds

Brussels sprout seeds are **easy to handle**—no soaking or stratification needed. You can plant them **directly in the garden** or **raise seedlings** in trays and transplant later.

### 1. Sow Directly

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **6 mm deep** and **50–75 cm apart** in rows **90–100 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist** but never **wet** or **dry**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–14 days** at a soil temperature of **7–25 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raise Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **high‑quality seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **6 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist** soil, avoiding waterlogged or dry conditions. |
| 4 | Germinate in **7–14 days** at **7–25 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **50–75 cm apart** in rows **90–100 cm apart**. |

> **Tip:** Brussels sprouts are a cool‑season crop. Avoid sowing or transplanting in **very hot weather** to prevent premature bolting.

## How to Grow Brussels Sprouts

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil moisture by **scratching 5 cm below the surface**.  
  - Water **deeply** in the **early morning** or **late afternoon**.  
  - **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  *[Learn more about watering here.]*

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is well‑prepared, **extra fertilizer is usually unnecessary**.  
  - In poorer soils or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertilizer** at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid fertilizer** at the recommended rate and frequency during fruiting or flowering.

## How to Harvest Brussels Sprouts

- **Harvest window:** **80–140 days** after sowing.  
- **Readiness:** Heads should be **firm, green, and 4–5 cm in diameter**.  
- **Method:**  
  1. Twist heads gently until they detach, starting from the **lower** ones.  
  2. Harvest only what you need; new heads will form higher up the stem.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Keep in a **perforated plastic bag** in the fridge.  
  - For longer storage, **blanch** and then **freeze**.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may leave honeydew attracting ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap/alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Bitter Taste** | Often due to slow growth, setbacks, or late harvest. | Enrich soil with aged manure, water deeply and regularly, harvest when heads are young and tender. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set, usually after extreme weather. | Sow after frost danger, avoid hot periods, water deeply during heat to reduce stress. |
| **Cabbage Moth / Cabbage White Butterfly** | White/grey wings with markings; caterpillars chew large holes or skeletonise leaves. | Use netting, deploy decoys, hand‑pick caterpillars, or apply targeted sprays. |
| **Cutworms** | Moth larvae in soil, 3–4 cm long, white/grey/brown; chew stems of seedlings. | Hand‑pick at night, use cardboard collars to protect stems. |
| **Heads Not Forming** | Often caused by warm weather or slow growth, lacking water/nutrients. | Grow in cooler months, water regularly, apply compost or fertilizer. |
| **Animals (Possums, Birds, etc.)** | Can destroy harvest overnight. | Use netting or cages, or spray with a homemade deterrent (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; can reduce yield. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide or homemade spray. |
