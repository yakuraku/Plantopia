# How to Grow Elephant Garlic Bulbs  

**Family:** Amaryllidaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Allium ampeloprasum_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial (usually grown as an annual)  

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Plant in a spot that receives *at least 6 hours of full sun* each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Loose, well‑drained loam enriched with organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, dig to at least a spade’s depth, and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - In heavy soils, adding organic matter lightens the texture, allowing roots to spread freely.  
- **Drainage:** If drainage is uncertain, mound the soil into rows or use raised beds.  
- **Weed control:** Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

## How to Plant Elephant Garlic  

Elephant garlic cloves thrive when planted directly into the garden.  

1. **Separate** the bulb into individual cloves.  
2. **Dig** small holes **5 cm deep**, spacing them **30 cm apart** in rows that are also 30 cm apart.  
3. **Plant** one clove per hole, placing the thick end at the bottom and the pointed end at the top.  
4. **Cover** with soil and **water well**.  
5. **Mulch** with an organic material such as straw or lucerne to retain moisture and suppress weeds.  
6. **Shoots** should appear in **2–6 weeks**.  

## How to Grow Elephant Garlic  

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil moisture 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - *Avoid wetting the leaves* to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil was well prepared, no extra fertilizer is usually needed.  
  - Over‑fertilizing can cause excessive leaf growth at the expense of bulb development.  
  - In poorer soils, use a **low‑nitrogen, high‑phosphorus** fertilizer (e.g., blood and bone) at the recommended rate.  

## How to Harvest Elephant Garlic  

- **Timing:** Bulbs are ready in **280–320 days**; under optimal conditions, they may take two years to reach full size.  
- **Indicator:** Harvest when the plant has **flowered** and the flowers have **dried**.  
- **Method:**  
  1. Gently lift the entire plant with a fork, shaking off excess soil.  
  2. Check one bulb first; if it’s small or unformed, wait **2–3 weeks** before harvesting the rest.  
- **Curing:**  
  - Place whole plants on wire racks or hang them in bunches.  
  - Cure in a dry, cool place for **3–10 weeks**.  
  - Softneck garlic can be braided afterward.  
  - Trim roots and stems to **2.5 cm** and store in a cool, dry place for up to **10 months**.  

## Common Problems When Growing Elephant Garlic  

Below are the most frequent issues and how to address them.  

- **Aphids**  
  - Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects that cluster on new shoots or leaf undersides.  
  - Symptoms: wilting, discoloration, honeydew that attracts ants.  
  - *Control:* spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects.  
  - *Read more about aphids here.*  

- **Bulbs Not Forming**  
  - Causes: early harvesting, inconsistent watering or weather, too‑small bulbs/cloves, excess nitrogen.  
  - *Prevention:* choose climate‑appropriate varieties, avoid over‑fertilizing, water consistently, and harvest after leaves begin to die.  
  - A single large bulb (a “round”) can be eaten or replanted in autumn for next season.  

- **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._)  
  - Fungal disease producing brown to orange raised spots or patches on foliage.  
  - Spreads by wind or water, especially at 10–20 °C with high humidity.  
  - *Management:* space plants to avoid overcrowding, provide full sun, avoid over‑fertilizing, remove dead material, and practice crop rotation.  
  - *Read more about rust fungus here.*  

- **Onion Thrips** (_Thrips tabaci_)  
  - Tiny (≤ 1.5 mm) pale yellow to light brown insects that suck sap, leaving silver patches.  
  - Can infest inner leaves, leaf folds, and bulbs.  
  - *Control:* wash plants with a garden hose, spread organic mulch, and encourage predatory mites and lacewings through companion planting.  

- **Powdery Mildew**  
  - Fungal spores create white spots that can spread across leaves.  
  - Rarely fatal but reduces yield.  
  - *Prevention:* water at soil level (not on leaves), ensure good airflow, remove affected leaves, and apply a suitable fungicide or homemade spray if needed.  
  - *Read more about powdery mildew here.*  

- **Rotten Bulbs or Corms**  
  - Pathogens attack bulbs in cold, wet soil, waterlogged conditions, or warm winter temperatures.  
  - Symptoms: rot, no roots or shoots, stunted yellow leaves, no flowers.  
  - *Prevention:* plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers; avoid watering during dormancy; lift and store bulbs if your climate requires it.  

- **Slugs and Snails**  
  - Molluscs that feed on tender leaves and shoots, mainly at night, leaving slimy trails.  
  - *Control:* remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, collect by torchlight, or use traps.
