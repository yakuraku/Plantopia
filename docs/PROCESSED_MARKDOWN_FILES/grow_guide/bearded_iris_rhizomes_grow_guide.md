# How to Grow Bearded Iris Rhizomes

**Family:** Iridaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Iris x germanica_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

---

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Bearded irises thrive in **full sun** – aim for at least **6 h of direct light** each day.  
- **Location:** Since they’re perennials, choose a **permanent spot** that won’t be disturbed by frequent digging.  
- **Leaves:** These plants are **evergreen**, so you’ll see foliage all year round.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs to be **loose, well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly **weed** the area, then dig to at least a spade’s depth.  
  - Add **aged animal manure or compost** to lighten heavy soils and boost fertility.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Tip:* A light layer of mulch after planting helps retain moisture and suppress weeds.

## How to Plant Bearded Iris Rhizomes

1. **Final Position:** Plant rhizomes where they’ll stay forever.  
2. **Leaf Management:**  
   - New rhizomes come with cut‑back leaves.  
   - When dividing, prune leaves to **≈15 cm** before planting.  
3. **Spacing:** Place rhizomes **20–40 cm apart** to give each plant room to spread.  
4. **Depth:**  
   - Roots should be **buried**.  
   - The **top of the rhizome** sits at soil surface.  
   - Cover the tops with **1–2 cm of soil** to shield them from sunburn.  
5. **Watering:** Water **well** after planting, then keep the soil **relatively dry**.

## How to Grow Bearded Iris

### Watering

- **Drought tolerant** once established.  
- Let the soil **dry out** between waterings; test by scratching 10 cm below the surface.  
- Water **deeply** in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
- **Avoid** wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilizing

- **No extra fertilizer** needed if soil is well prepared.  
- In poorer soils or for a boost:  
  - **High‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertilizer works well.  
  - **Slow‑release**: apply at transplanting or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
  - **Liquid**: apply during flowering or fruiting, following the label’s rate and frequency.

### Flowering

- Expect first blooms in the **summer after planting**.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading flowers just above a leaf set with sharp secateurs.  
  - This encourages more blooms.  
- For **cut flowers**:  
  - Cut stems **1–2 days before** buds open.  
  - Use clean, sharp tools and place stems immediately in water.  
  - Trim spent flowers to allow new buds to open.

### Foliage Care

- Remove **dead or untidy foliage** in summer to keep plants tidy.

### Rhizome Division

- **Every 3 years**: lift and divide to prevent overcrowding and boost flowering.  
  1. After flowering, use a garden fork to lift rhizomes with roots attached.  
  2. Divide with hands or a clean, sharp knife.  
  3. Replant rhizomes that still have buds and roots; discard old or dead ones.  
  4. Prune leaves back to **15 cm** before replanting.

## Common Problems & How to Handle Them

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention & Treatment |
|---------|----------|------------------------|
| **No flowers forming** | Plants stay leafy, no blooms | • Too much shade<br>• High‑nitrogen fertilizer<br>• Lack of cold winter<br>• Overcrowding | • Ensure **full sun**.<br>• Use **low‑nitrogen, flower‑promoting** fertilizer.<br>• Choose varieties suited to your climate.<br>• Lift and divide when needed. |
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Irregular brown spots that dry to scab‑like patches | • Wet leaves<br>• Poor drainage | • Water at **soil level** only.<br>• Remove fallen leaves and fruit.<br>• Practice crop rotation. |
| **Grey mould (Botrytis)** | Mouldy flowers, rotting fruit | • Cool, damp weather | • Prune affected flowers/fruit.<br>• Water at soil level.<br>• Use fungicide or homemade spray if necessary. |
| **Rust (Puccinia)** | Brown/orange raised spots on foliage | • 10–20 °C, high humidity | • Space plants to avoid overcrowding.<br>• Provide **full sun**.<br>• Avoid over‑fertilizing.<br>• Remove dead plants and rotate crops. |
| **Crown rot** | Lower stems/branches turn brown, plant dies from bottom up | • Excess soil moisture | • Reduce watering.<br>• Ensure excellent drainage.<br>• Consider raised beds or containers. |
| **Rotten rhizomes** | No roots or shoots, stunted yellow leaves, no flowers | • Cold, wet soil<br>• Waterlogged or warm winter | • Plant in **free‑draining** soil, raised beds, or containers.<br>• Do not overwater before shoots emerge. |
