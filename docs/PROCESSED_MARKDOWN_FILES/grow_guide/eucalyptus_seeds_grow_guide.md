## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Eucalyptus thrives in **full sun** – pick a spot that gets **at least 6 h of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Permanent spot:** Since they’re **perennial**, choose a location where the plants can stay undisturbed; avoid areas that will be dug up regularly.  
- **Spacing:** Mature eucalypts can grow large. Plant seedlings **200–500 cm apart** to give them room to spread.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs to be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, loosen the soil, and add **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

## How to Sow Eucalyptus Seeds

Eucalyptus seeds are **easy to handle** – no pre‑treatment (soaking, stratification) required.

1. **Seed‑raising mix**  
   - Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a high‑quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sowing depth**  
   - Sow seeds **2 mm deep**.  
3. **Moisture**  
   - Keep soil **moist but never wet or dry**.  
4. **Germination**  
   - Seeds germinate in **7–28 days** at a soil temperature of **18–21 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting**  
   - Move seedlings to the garden once they have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
   - Space them **200–500 cm apart** again.  

> **Tip:** Eucalyptus seeds are tiny. Mix them with a little sand or fine potting mix before sowing, or use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly. Press lightly into the soil surface to ensure good contact.

## How to Grow Eucalyptus

### Watering

- Water during the growing season **when the soil is dry** about **5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
- **Avoid** wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- *Learn more about watering* [here](#).

### Fertilizing

- If the soil was well prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is usually needed.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **low‑phosphorus** or **native‑plant** fertilizer:  
  - **Slow‑release**: apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings are **5–10 cm tall**.  
  - **Liquid**: apply at the recommended rate and frequency while plants are fruiting or flowering.  

### Cutting for Flowers or Foliage

- Use **sharp snips or secateurs** to cut branches to the desired length.  
- Remove lower leaves and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.  
- *Learn more about cutting and conditioning homegrown flowers* [here](#).

### Maturity

- Eucalyptus typically reaches maturity in **5–20 years**.

## Common Problems When Growing Eucalyptus

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention & Treatment |
|---------|----------|------------------------|
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; can reduce yields. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves.<br>• Ensure good airflow between plants.<br>• Remove affected leaves.<br>• Spray with appropriate fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Root rot** | Slow establishment, yellowing or wilted foliage, soft brown tissue at stem base and roots. | • Reduce soil moisture.<br>• Add organic matter.<br>• Keep mulch away from stems.<br>• Remove and dispose of affected plants. |
| **Myrtle rust** (_Puccinia psidii_) | Small purple dots on leaves, followed by bright yellow spores that fade to grey. | • Prune affected branches with disinfected tools.<br>• Treat with approved fungicide; repeat treatments may be necessary. |
