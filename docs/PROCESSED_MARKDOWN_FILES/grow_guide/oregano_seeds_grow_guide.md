# How to Grow Oregano Seeds

**Family:** Lamiaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Origanum sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot** – Oregano is a long‑lived herb, so pick a location that won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Sunlight** – Full sun to part shade. Aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil** – Needs *very well‑drained* conditions.  
  - No extra manure or fertilisers are usually required.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area and loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers** – Oregano grows well in pots.  
  - Use a variety suited for container growing.  
  - Choose a pot **≥ 10 L** to give roots room to spread.  
  - During the growing season, supplement with a balanced liquid fertiliser to keep plants healthy.

## How to Sow Oregano Seeds

Oregano seeds are tiny but hardy. They **don’t need any pre‑treatment** (soaking, stratification, etc.).

### Direct Sowing

1. **Depth & spacing** – Sow 5 mm deep, 50 cm apart.  
2. **Moisture** – Keep soil *moist but never soggy or dry*.  
3. **Germination** – 7–14 days at 18–21 °C.  
4. **Protection** – Shield young seedlings from pets, pests, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raising Seedlings First

1. **Containers** – Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sowing** – 5 mm deep, same moisture rule as above.  
3. **Germination** – 7–14 days at 18–21 °C.  
4. **Transplanting** – Move seedlings when they have their first true leaves and are 5–10 cm tall.  
5. **Spacing** – Plant out 50 cm apart.

> **Tip:** Because oregano seeds are so small, mix them with sand or fine potting mix before sowing, or use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly. Press lightly into the soil surface to ensure good seed‑soil contact.  

## How to Grow Oregano

- **Watering** – Once established, oregano is drought‑tolerant.  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings.  
  - Water only when the soil is dry about 10 cm below the surface (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
  - Water deeply in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.  
- **Fertilising** –  
  - *No extra fertiliser* needed if soil is well‑prepared.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertiliser** at transplant or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
    - **Liquid fertiliser** during fruiting or flowering, following the recommended rate and frequency.  
- **Pruning** – After flowering, trim back to tidy the plant and stimulate strong new growth. Use sharp secateurs or snips to cut stems just above a set of lower leaves.

## How to Harvest Oregano

- **Harvest window** – 85–100 days after sowing.  
- **Method** – Pinch off outer stems and leaves, leaving some on the plant for future growth.  
- **Short‑term storage** – Place in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
- **Long‑term storage** – Dry the herb:  
  1. Tie stems together with string.  
  2. Hang upside down in a warm, dry place until leaves feel dry.  
  3. Store in an airtight container.

## Common Problems When Growing Oregano

| Problem | Symptoms | Management |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** (2–4 mm) | New shoots or leaf undersides become wilted or discoloured; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose to dislodge them.<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Spider Mites** (Tetranychus urticae) | Dry, wilted, or discoloured leaves; undersides feel sandpaper‑like. | • Prune to improve airflow.<br>• Spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulphur. |
