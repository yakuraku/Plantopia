**Family:** Plantaginaceae  
**Binomial name:** *Penstemon sp.*  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

---

## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot** – Penstemon is a short‑lived perennial (2–5 years), so pick a location that won’t be disturbed by digging or heavy foot traffic.  
- **Sunlight** – Full sun to part shade. Aim for **at least 3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil** – Needs a well‑drained mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly.  
  - Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  - Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  

> *Tip:* A soil test can help you confirm pH and nutrient levels before you start.

## How to Sow Penstemon Seeds

### Optional: Stratification  
Stratifying seeds (exposing them to cold for a period) can speed up germination and improve success.  
_Read more about stratification here._

Penstemon seeds can be sown **directly in the garden** or **raised in trays** and transplanted later.

### 1. Sow Direct

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sprinkle seeds **2 mm deep** and **40 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but never waterlogged**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **14–21 days** at **20–24 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raise Seedlings

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a high‑quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **2 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist but not soggy** soil. |
| 4 | Germination: **14–21 days** at **20–24 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **40 cm apart** in the garden. |

> **Patience is key** – Penstemon seeds can be slow to germinate. Stick to the recommended depth and temperature for the best results.

## How to Grow Penstemon

### Watering  
- Water when the soil is **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (check by scratching a bit of soil).  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  

### Fertilising  
- If the soil was well prepared, **no extra fertilizer is needed**.  
- In poorer soil or to give a boost, use a **high‑potassium or flowering‑plant fertilizer**:  
  - **Slow‑release**: apply at transplanting or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
  - **Liquid**: apply at the recommended rate during flowering or fruiting.  

### Flowering & Pruning  
- Penstemon typically **flowers in 85–100 days**.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading or dead flowers just above a set of leaves with sharp secateurs or snips.  
- After flowering, **prune back** to tidy the plant and encourage new growth. Cut stems just above a lower leaf set.

## Common Problems When Growing Penstemon

| Problem | Symptoms | Management |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scab‑like patches; premature leaf and flower drop. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves.<br>• Dispose of fallen leaves and fruit.<br>• Practice crop rotation. |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._) | Brown to orange raised spots or patches on foliage; spread by wind or water, especially at 10–20 °C and high humidity. | • Space plants to avoid overcrowding.<br>• Provide recommended light (full sun).<br>• Avoid over‑fertilising.<br>• Remove dead plants and rotate crops. |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots that spread to cover leaves; reduces yield but rarely fatal. | • Water at soil level.<br>• Ensure good airflow between plants.<br>• Remove affected leaves.<br>• Use appropriate fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves and shoots, mainly at night; leave slimy trails. | • Remove hiding places.<br>• Keep free‑range poultry.<br>• Collect by torchlight or use traps. |

> *Pro tip:* Regular inspection and early intervention are the best defenses against these common issues.
