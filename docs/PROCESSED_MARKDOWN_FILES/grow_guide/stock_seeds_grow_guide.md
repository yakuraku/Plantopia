# How to Grow Stock Seeds

**Family:** Brassicaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Matthiola incana_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Stock loves *full sun* – pick a spot that gets at least **6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a *well‑drained* mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen, and enrich with aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, choose a variety suited for container life.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot of at least **10 L** for mature plants.  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Stock Seeds

Stock seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification required. You can sow them straight in the garden or raise seedlings first.

### 1. Direct Sowing

1. **Depth & spacing:** Plant 3 mm deep, 20–40 cm apart.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep the soil *moist but never waterlogged*.  
3. **Germination:** 7–14 days at 20–22 °C.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### 2. Raising Seedlings

1. **Containers:** Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix (or soil starter pellets).  
2. **Planting:** 3 mm deep, same moisture rule as above.  
3. **Germination:** 7–14 days at 20–22 °C.  
4. **Transplant:** When seedlings have their first true leaves and are 5–10 cm tall, move them to the garden.  
5. **Spacing:** 20–40 cm apart.

> **Tip:** For a quick start, try the *scatter seed* method: roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover.

## How to Grow Stock

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water deeply in the *early morning* or *late afternoon*.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilising:**  
  - If soil is already rich, skip extra fertiliser.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a high‑potassium or flowering‑plant formula:  
    - *Slow‑release* at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - *Liquid* during fruiting/flowering at the recommended rate.  
- **Thinning:** Once seedlings are sturdy, pull out weaker ones to give each plant 20–40 cm of space.  
- **Flowering:** Expect blooms in about **140 days**.  
- **Deadheading:** Trim fading or dead flowers just above a leaf set with sharp secateurs or snips. This encourages more blooms.  
- **Cut Flowers:** For stems, cut the longest possible stems, remove lower leaves, and place immediately in clean water.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Grey mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Mouldy flowers, rotting fruit; spreads in cool, damp weather. | Prune affected parts, water at soil level, apply fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Damping off** | Seeds fail to germinate or seedlings rot at the base. | Use fresh potting mix, avoid over‑watering, keep foliage dry. |
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level, remove/destroy affected leaves, ensure good airflow, consider milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Slimy trails, tender leaf damage, mainly at night. | Remove hiding spots, use free‑range poultry, set traps, or torchlight collection. |
