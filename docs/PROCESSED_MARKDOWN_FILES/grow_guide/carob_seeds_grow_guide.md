# How to Grow Carob Seeds

**Family:** Fabaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Ceratonia siliqua_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

---

## Preparation

Carob trees are **dioecious** – each plant is either male or female.  
* **Tip:** Plant more seedlings than you need, then keep the excess male plants for future use.  
* **Space:** Mature carobs can reach 10 m in width, so plant seedlings **10 m apart** to give them room to grow.  
* **Climate:** Thrives in warm to temperate zones. Avoid areas where winter temperatures drop below **–6 °C**.  
* **Sun:** Needs **≥6 h of full sun** daily.  
* **Soil:** Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  1. Weed thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging.  
  3. Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  4. Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  

> **Pro tip:** Choose a permanent spot – carobs are long‑lived and don’t like frequent digging.

## How to Sow Carob Seeds

### Scarification (Boost Germination)

Carob seeds have a tough coat. Scarifying lets water reach the embryo.

| Method | How to Do It |
|--------|--------------|
| **Knife nick** | Use a sharp knife to make a shallow cut on each seed. |
| **Sandpaper** | Gently rub a section of the husk with fine sandpaper or a nail file. |

### Raising Seedlings in Tubes

Carobs develop long taproots, so start them in deep containers.

1. **Fill** forestry tubes or deep pots with a fresh, high‑quality seed‑raising mix.  
2. **Plant** seeds **50 mm deep**.  
3. **Moisture**: Keep soil damp but never waterlogged.  
4. **Germination**: 12–38 days at **22–26 °C**.  
5. **Transplant** when seedlings reach **8–10 cm** tall—handle the taproot gently.  
6. **Spacing**: When moving to the garden, keep the **10 m** spacing rule.  

> **Protect** seedlings from grazing animals with stakes, netting, or a cage.

### Frost Sensitivity

- In cooler climates, wait until all frost danger has passed before planting out.  
- For the first two winters, mulch heavily or use frost covers.  

> **Patience is key**: Carob seeds can be slow to germinate, so stick to the depth and temperature guidelines.

## How to Grow Carob

### Watering

- **Drought tolerant** once established.  
- Let the soil dry out between waterings; test by scratching 10 cm below the surface.  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid** wetting the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.

### Fertilizing

- **No extra fertilizer** needed if soil is well‑prepared.  
- In poor soil or for a boost:  
  * **Slow‑release** fertilizer at transplanting or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
  * **Liquid** fertilizer during fruiting or flowering, following the recommended rate and frequency.

## How to Harvest Carob

| Harvest Type | When | How |
|--------------|------|-----|
| **Pulp (green pods)** | Spring, when pods are **10–15 cm**, green, and flexible | Cut with snips, secateurs, or a long‑handled tool. Fresh pods can be split and eaten (avoid seeds). |
| **Milling (dark brown pods)** | When pods turn dark brown and detach easily | Shake branches with a pole or rake to drop pods. Dry for 1–2 days in sun. Split, seed‑remove, and grind into powder, or store whole for up to a year. |

- **Carob trees** typically start fruiting in **5–8 years**.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **Damping off** | Fungal growth from soil to seed/seedling | Use fresh potting mix, avoid overwatering, keep foliage dry. |
| **Animal damage** | Possums, birds, etc. | Netting, cages, or homemade sprays (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **No fruit** | Only one sex planted | Ensure at least one male and one female plant per group; plant several at recommended spacing. |
