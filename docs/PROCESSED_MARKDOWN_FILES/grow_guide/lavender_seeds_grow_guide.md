# How to Grow Lavender Seeds

**Family:** Lamiaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Lavandula sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot** – Lavender is a long‑lived perennial, so pick a location that won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Full sun is a must** – Aim for at least **6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Well‑drained soil** – Lavender hates soggy roots.  
  - *No extra manure or fertilizer* is usually needed.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area and loosen the soil with a spade or tiller.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.

- **Container growing** – If you’re growing in pots:  
  - Pick a variety suited for containers.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - **Minimum 20 L pot** for mature plants.  
  - Container plants may need a bit more fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Lavender Seeds

> *Optional:* **Stratify** the seeds (cold treatment) to speed up germination.  
> Read more about stratification [here](#).

1. **Seed‑raising mix** – Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sow shallow** – Drop seeds **0 mm deep** (just on the surface).  
3. **Moisture** – Keep the soil damp, but never waterlogged.  
4. **Germination window** – Expect **14–21 days** at a soil temperature of **18–21 °C**.  
5. **Transplant** – Move seedlings outdoors once they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing** – Plant 40–80 cm apart.

### Tips

- **Patience is key** – Some varieties take longer to germinate. Stick to the depth and temperature guidelines for the best results.  
- **Handle tiny seeds carefully** – Mix them with sand or fine potting mix before sowing, or use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly.  
- **Press lightly** into the soil surface to ensure good seed‑soil contact.  
- Avoid seeds drying out or being washed away.

## How to Grow Lavender

- **Watering** –  
  - Water when the soil is dry **5 cm below the surface** (check by scratching a bit of soil).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - **Avoid wetting the leaves** to prevent fungal diseases.

- **Fertilizing** –  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertilizer** at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - **Liquid fertilizer** during flowering or fruiting, following the recommended rate and frequency.  
- **Pruning for density** – Pinch out the growing tips with sharp secateurs or snips, cutting just above a set of lower leaves. This encourages denser growth, stronger stems, and more flowers.  
- **Deadheading** – Remove fading or dead flowers just above a set of leaves to stimulate more blooms.  
- **Seasonal pruning** – After flowering, trim back to neaten and encourage new growth. Cut stems just above lower leaves; never prune into the woody base.

## How to Harvest Lavender

- **Timing** – Lavender is ready to harvest in about **356 days**.  
- **Buds** – Cut stems just above a set of leaves when buds are just before opening.  
- **Processing** – Remove leaves, tie stems with string, and hang upside down in a warm, dry place until the buds feel dry.  
- **Storage** – Keep dried buds in an airtight container.

## Common Problems When Growing Lavender

Lavender can face a few pests and diseases. Below are the most common issues and how to tackle them.

### Aphids

- Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects that cluster on new shoots or leaf undersides.  
- Symptoms: Wilted or discoloured leaves, honeydew that attracts ants.  
- **Control** –  
  - Spray with a garden hose.  
  - Use a soap or alcohol spray.  
  - Encourage predatory insects (ladybugs, lacewings).

### Whitefly

- Sap‑sucking insect similar to aphids, often found in large numbers on leaf undersides.  
- Symptoms: Yellowing leaves, wilting, stunted growth.  
- **Control** –  
  - Wash with a garden hose or spray with soap.  
  - Attract beneficial insects that prey on whitefly.  
  - Severely infested plants may need to be destroyed.
