## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Kale loves *full sun* – pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a *well‑drained* mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, dig it up to loosen the soil, and mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.

## How to Sow Kale Seeds

Kale seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification needed.  
You can **direct‑sow** them in the garden or **raise seedlings** in trays and transplant later.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **10 mm deep** and **40–60 cm apart**; keep rows **50–100 cm** apart. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist** but never *wet* or *dry*. |
| 3 | Germination takes **6–12 days** at a soil temperature of **8–30 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **high‑quality seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **10 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Keep soil **moist** but never *wet* or *dry*. |
| 4 | Germination takes **6–12 days** at **8–30 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **40–60 cm apart**; keep rows **50–100 cm** apart. |

> **Tip:** Kale is a *cool‑season* crop. Avoid sowing or transplanting in very hot weather to prevent premature bolting.

## How to Grow Kale

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil moisture **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - *Avoid wetting the leaves* to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is well‑prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is usually needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑nitrogen** or leafy‑green‑specific fertilizer:  
    - **Slow‑release:** apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid:** apply at the recommended rate and frequency throughout the season.

## How to Harvest Kale

- **Timing:** Kale is ready in **50–70 days**.  
- **Method:**  
  - Harvest when leaves are large enough to eat.  
  - Cut or twist the outer leaves close to the stem, leaving some for future growth.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Keep in a **perforated plastic bag** in the fridge.  
  - For longer storage, **blanch** and then **freeze** the leaves.

## Common Problems When Growing Kale

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose. <br>• Use soap or alcohol spray. <br>• Encourage predatory insects. <br>• *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Bitter Taste** | Often due to slow growth, setbacks, or late harvest. | • Enrich soil with aged manure before planting. <br>• Water deeply and regularly. <br>• Harvest when leaves are young and tender. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed production, usually after extreme weather. | • Sow after frost danger has passed or avoid hot weather. <br>• Water regularly and deeply during heat to prevent stress. |
| **Cabbage Moth / Cabbage White Butterfly** | White or grey wings with markings; eggs on leaf undersides; caterpillars create holes or skeletonize leaves. | • Use netting or decoys to deter. <br>• Pick caterpillars off plants. <br>• Apply selective sprays if needed. <br>• *Read more about cabbage moth and cabbage white butterfly here.* |
| **Cutworms** | Moth larvae in soil; 3–4 cm long, white/grey/brown; chew through tender stems at night. | • Hand‑pick at night. <br>• Use cardboard collars to protect seedlings. |
| **Possums, Birds, Other Animals** | Can destroy a large portion of the harvest overnight. | • Exclude with netting or cages. <br>• Try a homemade spray of garlic, fish oil, or mustard. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; reduces yield but rarely fatal. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves. <br>• Ensure good airflow between plants. <br>• Remove affected leaves. <br>• Use fungicide or homemade spray if necessary. <br>• *Read more about powdery mildew here.* |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insects, often in large numbers on leaf undersides; cause yellowing, wilting, and slowed growth. | • Spray with garden hose or soap spray. <br>• Destroy badly affected plants. <br>• Attract beneficial insects that prey on whitefly. <br>• *Read more about managing whitefly here.* |
