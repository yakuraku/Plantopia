# How to Grow Tomato Seeds

**Family:** Solanaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Solanum lycopersicum_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Tomatoes love full sun—pick a spot that gets **at least 6 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a well‑drained mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, loosen the soil, and add **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Pest & Disease Prevention:**  
  - Practice **crop rotation**—never plant tomatoes in the same spot two years in a row.  
  - *Read more about crop rotation here.*  
- **Container Growing:**  
  - Choose a variety labeled for containers.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a **minimum 40 L pot**.  
  - Container plants often need extra fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Tomato Seeds

Tomato seeds are simple—no soaking or stratification required.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep** and **50 cm apart**; rows 60–70 cm apart. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but never waterlogged**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **5–10 days** at **21–27 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist but not soggy** soil. |
| 4 | Germinate in **5–10 days** at **21–27 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **50 cm apart**; rows 60–70 cm apart. |

> **Tip:** Tomatoes are frost‑sensitive. Don’t transplant or sow outdoors until the danger of frost has passed.  
> In cooler climates, start seeds indoors **6 weeks before the last expected frost** in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Tomato

### Watering

- Water when the soil is **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (check by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
- **Deep watering** in the early morning or late afternoon is best.  
- Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- *Learn more about watering here.*

### Fertilizing

- If soil is well‑prepared, no extra fertilizer is needed.  
- For poor soil or a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release fertilizer** at transplant or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
  - **Liquid fertilizer** during fruiting or flowering, following the recommended rate and frequency.

### Support & Pruning

| Plant Type | Support | Pruning |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Indeterminate** | Staking or trellis needed. Use sturdy stakes or a tripod; tie stems gently with twine or plant ties. Place support before sowing to avoid root disturbance. | Optional: prune to two main stems to improve airflow and focus energy on fruit. *Read more about pruning tomatoes here.* |
| **Determinate** | Usually not required, but staking can help support heavy fruit. | – |

## How to Harvest Tomatoes

- **Harvest window:** **60–100 days** after sowing.  
- **Readiness:** Fruit changes color.  
- **Method:** Cut with snips or twist to detach.  
- **Regular harvesting** encourages more fruit.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Room temperature: fruit continues to ripen.  
  - Short‑term: keep at room temperature.  
  - Long‑term: refrigerate, freeze, can, or dry.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Handle |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm), sap‑sucking insects on new shoots/undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, honeydew, and attract ants. | Spray with garden hose, use soap/alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Queensland Fruit Fly** _(Bactrocera tryoni)_ | Eggs in fruit; fruit rots from inside, falls early, larvae visible when cut open. | Dispose of fallen fruit, use insect‑exclusion netting, install traps. *Read more about Queensland fruit fly here.* |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking, often in large numbers on leaf undersides; causes yellowing, wilting, slowed growth. | Hose spray or soap spray; destroy badly affected plants; attract beneficial insects. *Read more about managing whitefly here.* |
| **Blossom End Rot** | Calcium deficiency; fruit darkens from bottom up, becomes hard. | Discard affected fruit, water regularly and evenly, correct soil pH and nutrients. *Read more about blossom end rot here.* |
| **Split/Cracked Fruit** | Overwatering or heavy rain during fruit development; skin splits. | Water evenly, mulch thickly to moderate soil moisture; pick ripe fruit early. |
| **Catfacing** | Deformed, cracked, pitted fruit; often from low temps, flower damage, or excess nitrogen. | Still edible; trim hard parts. |
| **Sunscald** | White marks or blisters, often mounded; young fruit most vulnerable. | Avoid pruning leaves in peak summer; shade with light fabric on hot days. |
| **Buzz‑Pollinated** | Requires vibration for pollen release; lack of pollination means no fruit. | Plant companion flowers to attract bees; manually shake plants or use an electric toothbrush on each flower stem for ~5 s every few days. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots on leaves that spread; reduces yield. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, spray fungicide or homemade spray if needed. *Read more about powdery mildew here.* |
| **Possums, Birds, Other Animals** | Can destroy harvest overnight. | Use netting or cages; try homemade sprays (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Armyworms, Cutworms, Caterpillars** | Eat inside fruit, leaving holes. | Monitor fruit, remove caterpillars, use netting or fruit bags, spray with Dipel if necessary. |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium Wilt** | Soil‑borne fungi; roots block water/nutrients; leaves wilt, dry, yellow. | No cure—choose resistant varieties, dispose of infected plants, practice good hygiene and crop rotation. |
| **Cutworms** | Moth larvae in soil; chew through tender seedlings. | Remove by hand at night or use cardboard collars to protect stems. |
