# How to Grow Dichondra Seeds

**Family:** Convolvulaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Dichondra repens_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Light:** Dichondra thrives in *part shade*. Pick a spot that gets **3–6 hours of full sun** each day, but avoid afternoon blaze.  
- **Longevity:** As a perennial, it will stay for years. Choose a *permanent* location where it won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Spread:** Once established, it spreads rapidly via underground stolons. To keep it from invading unwanted areas, plant it in a lawn or bed with a clear edging, or grow it in a container.  
- **Soil:** Needs *well‑drained* soil rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, then dig over to loosen.  
  - For a lawn substitute, rake to level the seed bed and water to break any hydrophobic surface.  
  - In sandy soil, add **5 cm of compost** or good‑quality topsoil before planting.  
- **Weed control:** Keep the area weed‑free until planting—especially critical for lawns, as dichondra can’t compete with grasses once seedlings emerge.  
- **Containers:** If you prefer pots, pick a variety suited to container growth. Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot of at least **10 L**. Container plants may need extra fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Dichondra Seeds

Dichondra seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking or stratification required. You can sow them directly in the garden or raise seedlings in trays before transplanting.

### 1. Sow Direct as a Lawn Substitute

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Scatter seeds at **10 g m⁻²**. |
| 2 | Lightly rake to cover, then press the seed into the soil with a roller, flat wood, or similar. |
| 3 | Water gently—keep soil moist but **never wet or dry**. You may need to water several times a day. |
| 4 | Germination takes **7–14 days** at **18–24 °C**. |
| 5 | After emergence, water every other day, then taper to twice a week during the first season. |

### 2. Sow Direct in Garden Beds

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Plant seeds **5 mm deep** and **20 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Maintain moist soil (never wet or dry). |
| 3 | Germinate in **7–14 days** at **18–24 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and weather until they’re established. |

### 3. Raise Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Keep soil moist (never wet or dry). |
| 4 | Germinate in **7–14 days** at **18–24 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **5–20 cm apart** when planting out. |

## How to Grow Dichondra

- **Watering:** Check soil 5 cm below the surface—scratch a bit with your finger. Water when dry.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to prevent fungal diseases.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, skip extra fertilizer.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a balanced fertilizer or one for fruits/veg.  
    - **Slow‑release**: apply at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid**: apply during fruiting or flowering at the recommended rate/frequency.  
- **Maturity:** Dichondra reaches full size in about **120 days**.  
- **Maintenance:** If you want a uniform height, mow occasionally—just don’t remove too much foliage.

## Common Problems When Growing Dichondra

| Issue | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|-------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Cutworms** | Moth larvae (3–4 cm, white/grey/brown) that chew through tender stems at night. | Hand‑pick at night or use cardboard collars to shield seedlings. |
