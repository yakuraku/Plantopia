# How to Grow Malabar Spinach Seeds

**Family:** Basellaceae  
**Binomial name:** *Basella sp.*  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial (grown as an annual in cool climates)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Plant in a spot that receives **at least 6 h of full sun** each day.  
- **Location:** Since Malabar spinach is a perennial, choose a **permanent spot** where the plants can grow without frequent digging.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, loosen the soil, and add **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Use a variety labeled for container growing if you’re planting in pots.  
  - A **minimum of 40 L** pot is recommended for mature plants.  
  - Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Malabar Spinach Seeds

1. **No pre‑treatment** needed—just sow directly.  
2. **Planting depth & spacing:**  
   - Sow seeds **10 mm deep** and **20 cm apart**.  
3. **Moisture:** Keep the soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
4. **Germination:**  
   - 10–21 days at **24–30 °C**.  
5. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  
6. **Frost caution:**  
   - Malabar spinach is frost‑sensitive. **Do not transplant or sow outdoors** until the danger of frost has passed.  
7. **Indoor start (optional):** In cooler climates, start seeds indoors **6 weeks before the last expected frost** in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Malabar Spinach

- **Watering:**  
  - Keep soil **evenly moist** but avoid waterlogging.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - **Do not wet the leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- **Fertilising:**  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra fertiliser.  
  - For a boost or poorer soil:  
    - **Slow‑release fertiliser** at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm** tall.  
    - **Liquid fertiliser** at the recommended rate and frequency during the growing season.  
- **Support & Growth Habit:**  
  - Plants can **sprawl** or climb a trellis, wire fence, or tripod.  
  - If using a support, tie gently with twine or plant ties.  
  - **Set up support before sowing** to avoid disturbing roots later.  
- **Annual vs. Perennial:**  
  - In tropical/subtropical zones, grow year‑round.  
  - In temperate/cool zones, treat as a warm‑season annual.  
  - To keep perennials in cool climates:  
    - **Overwinter pots** in a sheltered, frost‑free spot, or  
    - Take tip cuttings in late summer and grow them indoors over winter to re‑plant in spring.

## How to Harvest Malabar Spinach

- **Harvest window:** Approximately **60–70 days** after sowing.  
- **When ready:** Leaves are large enough to eat.  
- **Method:** Pinch off leaves, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
- **Best use:** Consume fresh soon after harvest.  
- **Short‑term storage:** Keep in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
- **Long‑term storage:** Blanch leaves, then freeze.

## Common Problems When Growing Malabar Spinach

| Problem | Symptoms | Management |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose to dislodge them. <br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray. <br>• Encourage natural predators. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Irregular brown spots on stems, leaves, and flowers that dry into scab‑like patches; premature leaf and flower drop. | • Water at soil level, not on foliage. <br>• Remove and dispose of fallen leaves and fruit. <br>• Practice crop rotation. |
