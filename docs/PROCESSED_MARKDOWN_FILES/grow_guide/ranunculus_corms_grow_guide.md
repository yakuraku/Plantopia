## 1. Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Aim for **at least 3 hours of full sun** per day. Partial shade works, but full sun gives the best blooms.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Choose a **loose, well‑drained** mix.  
  - Work in **aged animal manure or compost** to enrich the soil.  
  - For heavy soils, dig in organic matter to lighten it so roots can grow freely.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, pick a variety labeled for container use.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot that holds **at least 10 L**.  
  - Container plants often need a little extra fertilizer during the growing season.

## 2. How to Plant Ranunculus Corms

1. **Optional soak:**  
   - Soak corms in **room‑temperature water for 1–3 hours** before planting.  
   - Swelling indicates absorption; don’t exceed the time limit to avoid rot.  
2. **Planting depth & spacing:**  
   - Place each corm **15 cm apart** and **5 cm deep**.  
   - Position the “claws” (the pointed end) **downward**.  
3. **Cover & water:**  
   - Gently cover with soil and water well.  
   - Keep the soil **moist but not soggy** until shoots appear.

## 3. Growing Ranunculus

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface; water when it feels dry.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is already rich, skip extra fertilizer.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - *Liquid fertilizer* at the recommended rate when buds start forming.  
    - *Slow‑release fertilizer* in early spring.  
- **Bloom Time:**  
  - Expect flowers in **90–120 days**.  
- **Deadheading:**  
  - Trim faded or dead flowers **just above a leaf set** with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - Regular deadheading encourages more blooms.  
- **Cut‑flower care:**  
  - Cut the longest stems with sharp tools, remove lower leaves, and place stems immediately in clean water.

## 4. Corm Management

- **Annual vs. Perennial:**  
  - *Annuals:* Discard after flowering.  
  - *Perennials:* Lift, store, and replant in autumn.  
- **Lifting Procedure:**  
  1. Cut foliage at ground level.  
  2. Use a garden fork to lift corms, handling gently.  
  3. Spread on a wire rack in a cool, dry spot for **10–14 days** to dry.  
  4. Store in a net bag or just‑damp vermiculite until replanting.

## 5. Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots/undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap/alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level, remove/destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding. If persistent, use homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, apply fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Rotten Corms** | Corms rot, no roots or shoots; often from cold, wet soil or over‑soaking. | Plant in well‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers. Lift and store perennials over winter. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Tender leaves and shoots eaten, slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, use free‑range poultry, torchlight collection, or traps. |
