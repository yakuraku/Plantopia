# How to Grow Tritonia Bulbs

**Family:** Iridaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Tritonia crocata_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Tritonia thrives in *full sun* – aim for at least **6 hours of direct light** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **loose, well‑drained** mix enriched with organic matter.  
  - Weed the area, dig to a *spade’s depth* (≈15 cm), and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Heavy soils can be lightened by adding organic matter so roots can grow freely.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you prefer pots, choose a variety labeled for **container growing**.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot of at least **20 L**.  
  - Container plants may need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Plant Tritonia Bulbs

1. **Plant directly** in their final spot (garden bed or container).  
2. **Spacing & depth:**  
   - Place bulbs **8 cm apart**.  
   - Dig a hole **5 cm deep** and set the bulb with the pointed tip facing **upwards**.  
3. **Cover & water:**  
   - Fill the hole with soil and water **well**.  
   - Keep the soil **moist but not waterlogged** until shoots appear.

## Growing the Plant

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil moisture by feeling **5 cm below the surface**.  
  - Water deeply in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilising:**  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra feed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertiliser:  
    - *Slow‑release* at the rate recommended when shoots emerge, **or**  
    - *Liquid* at the recommended rate and frequency when shoots emerge.  
  - After flowering, fertilise with **blood & bone** or aged/pelletised chicken manure, then water well.  
- **Flowering Time:** Expect blooms in **120–180 days**.

## After Flowering

- **Deadhead:**  
  - Regularly trim spent flowers with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - Cut stems for picking with the longest stems possible, or snap off dead blooms.  
  - This redirects energy back into the bulb rather than seed production.  
- **Foliage Management:**  
  - Let leaves die back naturally; the bulb will absorb nutrients for next season.  
  - Once all foliage has browned, trim individual leaves at ground level with sharp tools.

## Bulb Longevity & Storage

- **In‑ground life:** Bulbs can stay planted for years; no need to lift unless overcrowded or you want to relocate them.  
- **Mulch:** Apply a heavy mulch layer to shield bulbs from extreme summer heat.  
- **Lifting (if needed):**  
  1. Use a garden fork to gently lift bulbs, avoiding damage.  
  2. Prune any dead leaves still attached.  
  3. Store in a **cool, dry** area on a wire rack or a netting bag that allows airflow.  
  4. Ideal storage temperature: **≈20 °C**; avoid >30 °C, which can reduce viability.  
  5. Re‑plant the following season following the planting chart above.

## Common Problems

| Problem | What to Watch For | Quick Fix |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects |
| **Rotten bulbs/corms** | Bulbs show rot, lack roots/shoots, or produce stunted yellow leaves | Plant in well‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers; avoid watering during dormancy; lift and store if climate is wet |
| **Slugs & snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves, leaving slimy trails, mainly at night | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use traps, or torchlight collection |
