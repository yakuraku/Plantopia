# How to Grow Bottle Tree Seeds

**Family:** Sterculiaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Brachychiton rupestris_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Bottle trees thrive in *full sun*. Pick a spot that receives **at least 6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Permanent location:** Because they’re perennial, choose a **permanent spot** where the plants won’t be disturbed by regular digging or heavy traffic.  
- **Spacing:** Mature bottle trees can grow large, so plant seedlings **at least 5 m (500 cm) apart** to give them room to spread.  
- **Soil:** They need *very well‑drained* soil.  
  - No need for manure or extra fertilisers in most cases.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area and loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  - Keep the planting zone weed‑free until you sow the seeds.  
  - For more on soil prep, see [Preparing Soil for Planting](#).

## How to Sow Bottle Tree Seeds

Soaking seeds can *soften hard seed coats*, break dormancy, and boost germination rates.  
Read more about soaking seeds [here](#).

You can **sow directly in the garden** or **raise seedlings in trays** and transplant later.

### Sow Directly

1. **Plant** seeds **5 mm deep** in the garden.  
2. **Space** them **5 m apart**.  
3. **Moisture:** Keep the soil *moist but never soggy or dry*.  
4. **Germination:** Seeds should sprout in **10–21 days** at a soil temperature of **20–24 °C**.  
5. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raise Seedlings First

1. **Containers:** Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots filled with a high‑quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Planting depth:** Sow seeds **5 mm deep**.  
3. **Moisture:** Maintain *moist* soil, avoiding both waterlogging and dryness.  
4. **Germination:** Expect **10–21 days** at **20–24 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting:** Move seedlings outdoors once they develop their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing:** When planting out, keep the **5 m spacing** rule.

## How to Grow Bottle Trees

- **Watering:**  
  - Bottle trees are *drought tolerant* once established.  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings.  
  - Water only when the soil is dry **10 cm below the surface** (check by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - For more on watering, see [Watering Guide](#).

- **Fertiliser:** They thrive in *nutrient‑poor* soils and usually **don’t need extra fertiliser** during the growing season.

- **Leaf habit:**  
  - In warm climates, bottle trees are **evergreen**.  
  - In temperate or cool climates, they become **deciduous to semi‑deciduous**, dropping leaves just before spring flowering.

- **Growth rate:** Bottle trees are **slow growers**.  
  - The iconic bottle‑shaped trunk typically develops after **5–8 years**.

## Common Problems When Growing Bottle Trees

Like all plants, bottle trees can face pests, diseases, and other issues. Below are the most common problems and how to tackle them:

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention / Remedy |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Root rot** | Slow establishment, yellowing or wilted foliage, soft brown tissue at stem base and roots. | • Reduce soil moisture.<br>• Add organic matter to improve drainage.<br>• Ensure mulch does **not touch** the stems.<br>• If infected, remove and dispose of the plant. |

*Tip:* Regularly check the soil moisture and keep the root zone dry to keep root rot at bay.
