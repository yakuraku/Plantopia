## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Hardenbergia thrives in **full sun** or **part shade**. Pick a spot that receives at least **3 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Permanent spot:** As a perennial, it will live for several years. Choose a location that won’t be disturbed by regular digging or heavy foot traffic.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs **well‑drained** soil rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, loosen the soil, and mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.

## How to Sow Hardenbergia Seeds

1. **Pre‑treatment (optional but helpful)**  
   - *Soaking:* Soak seeds in water to soften hard coats and break dormancy.  
     *Read more about soaking seeds here.*  
   - *Smoke treatment:* Not required, but can speed germination.  
     *Read more about smoke treatment here.*

2. **Seed‑raising**  
   - Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots filled with a **high‑quality seed‑raising mix** or soil starter pellets.  
   - Sow seeds **5 mm deep**.  
   - Keep the soil **moist but not waterlogged**.  
   - Germination takes **14–21 days** at a soil temperature of **20–22 °C**.

3. **Transplanting**  
   - Move seedlings to the garden once they develop their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
   - Space plants **200 cm apart** to allow room for growth.

> **Tip:** Many native seeds are dormant and may take longer than expected. Follow pre‑treatment steps and be patient.

## How to Grow Hardenbergia

- **Watering**  
  - Water when the soil feels dry **5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil).  
  - Apply water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*

- **Fertilising**  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
  - If soil is poor or you want a boost:  
    - **Low‑phosphorus** or native‑plant fertilizer.  
    - *Apply slow‑release fertilizer* at transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - *Apply liquid fertilizer* during fruiting or flowering, following the recommended rate and frequency.

- **Support**  
  - Hardenbergia needs a **trellis** or sturdy support.  
  - Gently tie plants with twine or plant ties.  
  - Set up the support **before sowing** to avoid disturbing roots later.  
  - Alternatively, grow it as a **sprawling groundcover**.

- **Flowering & Pruning**  
  - Expect first blooms in **≈ 350 days**.  
  - After flowering, prune to tidy the plant and stimulate vigorous new growth.  
  - Use sharp secateurs or snips to cut stems just above a set of lower leaves.

## Common Problems When Growing Hardenbergia

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention & Remedy |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; may reduce yield | • Water at soil level, not on leaves.<br>• Ensure good airflow between plants.<br>• Remove affected leaves.<br>• Apply suitable fungicide or homemade spray. <br>*Read more about powdery mildew here.* |
| **Root rot** | Slow establishment, yellowing or wilting foliage, soft brown tissue at stem base and roots | • Reduce soil moisture.<br>• Add organic matter.<br>• Keep mulch away from stems.<br>• If infected, remove and discard the plant. |
