# How to Grow Watermelon Seeds  

**Family:** Cucurbitaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Citrullus vulgaris_ **or** _C. lanatus_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Watermelons love *full sun*. Pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, then dig it up to loosen the soil.  
  - Work in **aged animal manure or compost** to boost fertility.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
  - For more on soil prep, see the guide on *preparing soil for planting*.

## How to Sow Watermelon Seeds  

Watermelon seeds are simple to handle—no soaking or stratification needed.  

1. **Direct sow**:  
   - Plant seeds **20 mm deep**.  
   - Space them **60–80 cm apart** within a row.  
   - Keep rows **150–180 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep the soil **moist but never soggy or dry**.  
3. **Germination:**  
   - Expect **10–14 days** for sprouts.  
   - Ideal soil temperature: **27–32 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  
5. **Frost warning:** Watermelons are frost‑sensitive. **Never transplant or sow outdoors** until the danger of frost has passed.

## How to Grow Watermelon  

### Watering  

- Water when the soil feels dry **about 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
- Aim for **deep, infrequent watering** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid wetting the leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilizing  

- If your soil was well‑prepared, you may not need extra fertilizer.  
- For poor soil or a performance boost:  
  - **Slow‑release fertilizer**: apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm tall**.  
  - **Liquid fertilizer**: apply at the recommended rate and frequency during fruiting or flowering.

### Support  

- **Ground growing:** Allow at least **2 m² per plant**.  
- **Trellis growing:** Vines will climb using tendrils; add extra support by gently tying with twine or plant ties.  
- **Large fruit:** Use a sling made from netting to keep the fruit from breaking the vine.  
- **Set up support early**—install it when sowing or transplanting to avoid disturbing roots later.

### Optional Tips  

- **Pinch the growing tip** of the vine to control plant size and encourage side shoots that bear fruit.  
- **Mulch** under ripening fruit with straw or sugar cane to help prevent rot.

## How to Harvest Watermelon  

- **Harvest window:** **70–120 days** after planting.  
- **Ripeness cues:**  
  - The tendril opposite the fruit turns **green to brown**.  
  - Tap the fruit firmly; a **hollow sound** indicates maturity.  
  - Look for a slight yellowing on the underside.  
  - The melon should feel **heavy for its size** and emit a sweet aroma.  
- **Cutting:** Slice the melon from the vine, leaving **5–10 cm of stem** attached.  
- **Storage:** Keep harvested fruit in the fridge; watermelon is best enjoyed within a few days.

## Common Problems When Growing Watermelon  

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Not Setting Fruit** | Flowers fall off or tiny fruit shrivel and rot—often due to poor pollination. | Wait for both male and female flowers. Use a paintbrush to transfer pollen from male to female flowers. |
| **Animals (possums, birds, etc.)** | Can destroy a large portion of the harvest overnight. | Use netting or cages; try a homemade spray of garlic, fish oil, or mustard. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; can reduce yields. | Water at soil level (not on leaves), improve airflow, remove affected leaves, and apply a suitable fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Sunscald** | White marks or blisters on fruit, often moldering; young, unripe fruit are most vulnerable. | Avoid pruning leaves during peak summer; leaves shade and protect fruit. Cover plants with light fabric on very hot days. |
