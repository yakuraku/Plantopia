## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Aim for *at least 3 hours of full sun* each day, or a sunny spot with some afternoon shade.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Loose, well‑drained mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, dig to a *spade’s depth* to break up compacted layers.  
  - Mix in aged animal manure or compost to lighten heavy soils and boost fertility.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  

- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a pot that’s **recommended for Lachenalia** (usually 20 L or larger).  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Remember: container plants often need *extra fertiliser* during the growing season.

## How to Plant Lachenalia Bulbs  

1. **Position:** Plant directly in the garden or container; no need to move them later.  
2. **Depth & Orientation:**  
   - Place each bulb *just under the soil surface*.  
   - Cover with **2–3 cm of soil**.  
   - Point the *tapered tip upward*.  
3. **Watering:** Water well after planting.  
4. **Dry Period:** Keep the soil **relatively dry** until shoots appear.

## Growing & Care  

### Watering  
- Lachenalia are *drought‑tolerant* once established.  
- Let the soil dry out between waterings; test by scratching 10 cm below the surface.  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- *Learn more about watering here.*  

### Fertilising  
- **No extra fertiliser** needed if soil is well prepared; bulbs store enough energy.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at the recommended rate when shoots emerge, **or**  
  - **Liquid** fertilizer at the recommended rate and frequency when shoots emerge.  
- After flowering, apply **blood & bone** or aged/pelletised chicken manure and water well.  

### Flowering & Foliage  
- Flowers appear in **120–180 days**.  
- Let foliage die back naturally; the bulb reabsorbs nutrients for next season.  
- Once all leaves are dead, trim them at ground level with sharp secateurs or snips.  

### Mulching & Climate Protection  
- **Cool climates:** Mulch heavily in winter to shield bulbs from frost.  
- **Hot summers:** Mulch to keep bulbs cool; avoid overheating.  
- Bulbs can stay in the ground for years—no need to lift unless overcrowded or in wet summers.

## Bulb Management  

### Lifting (if needed)  
1. Use a garden fork to gently lift bulbs, avoiding damage.  
2. Prune any dead leaves still attached.  
3. Store in a **cool, dry** area on a wire rack or a netting bag for airflow.  
4. Ideal storage temperature: **≈20 °C**.  
5. Avoid temperatures >30 °C, which can reduce viability.  
6. Replant the following season following the planting chart above.

## Common Problems & Solutions  

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention / Remedy |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Rotten bulbs or corms** | No roots or shoots, stunted yellow leaves, no flowers | • Use free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers.<br>• Do not water during dormancy.<br>• Lift and store bulbs if your climate is wet. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Slimy trails, tender leaf damage, mainly at night | • Remove hiding places.<br>• Keep free‑range poultry.<br>• Use torchlight to spot them or set traps.<br>• Read more about slugs and snails here. |
