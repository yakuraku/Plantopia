## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Dill loves *full sun* – pick a spot that gets **at least 6 h of direct sunshine** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, dig over to loosen, then mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Dill can thrive in pots; choose a variety suited for container growing.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of **≥20 L** to give the roots room to grow.  
  - Remember: container plants often need a bit more fertiliser during the season.

## How to Sow Dill Seeds

Dill seeds are *easy* – no pretreatment needed.

1. **Direct sow**:  
   - 2 mm deep, 20 cm apart.  
   - Keep the soil **moist but never soggy or dry**.  
2. **Germination**:  
   - 7–21 days at **18–22 °C**.  
3. **Protection**:  
   - Shield seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  

**Tip:** If you’re in a hurry, try the *scatter seed* method: roughen the surface, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil.

## How to Grow Dill

| Task | What to Do | When |
|------|------------|------|
| **Watering** | Water when the top 5 cm of soil feels dry (scratch a bit with your finger).  Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk. | Throughout the growing season |
| **Fertilising** | If the soil is already rich, skip extra fertiliser.  For poorer soil or a boost: |  |
| | • **Slow‑release**: apply at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm. |  |
| | • **Liquid**: follow the label’s rate and frequency during the season. |  |
| **Thinning** | Pull out weak or small seedlings once they’re big enough to handle, spacing the healthy ones **≈20 cm apart**. | When seedlings are large enough |
| **Support** | Use stakes, bamboo canes, trellises, or string lines to keep taller plants upright.  Set up support **before** sowing or transplanting to avoid root disturbance. | As needed |

## How to Harvest Dill

- **Leaves**  
  - Harvest when they’re large enough to eat.  
  - Pinch off outer leaves, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
  - **Best flavour** just before the plant starts to flower.  
  - *Short‑term storage*: keep in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - *Long‑term*: dry, freeze, or pickle the leaves.

- **Seeds**  
  - Seeds turn brown **2–3 weeks after flowering**.  
  - Cut seed heads with sharp secateurs, place in a paper bag, and keep in a warm, dry spot for ~2 weeks.  
  - Once dry, seeds will fall off; separate them from plant material.  
  - Store in an airtight container.

## Common Problems When Growing Dill

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Fix It |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Tiny (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set, often after a heat wave or frost. | Sow after frost danger, keep plants well‑watered and deep in hot weather. |
| **Damping Off** | Seeds fail to germinate or seedlings rot at the base, becoming soft and mushy. | Use fresh potting mix, avoid overwatering, keep foliage dry. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level, remove/destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding, consider homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, spray with suitable fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Night‑time feeding on tender leaves, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, use free‑range poultry, torchlight traps, or other slug control methods. |
