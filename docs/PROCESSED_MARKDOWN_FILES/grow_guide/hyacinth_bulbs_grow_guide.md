# How to Grow Hyacinth Bulbs

**Family:** Asparagaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Hyacinthus orientalis_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

Hyacinths love **full sun or part shade**—aim for at least **3 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
They thrive in a **loose, well‑drained soil** enriched with organic matter.  
* **Weed** the area thoroughly.  
* **Dig** to a spade’s depth (≈ 30 cm) to loosen the soil.  
* Add **aged animal manure** or **compost** to lighten heavy soils and boost fertility.  
* Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.

### Growing in Containers

If you’re planting in pots, choose a variety labeled **“container‑friendly.”**  
* Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
* Pick a pot that holds at least **10 L** (≈ 2.5 gal) for mature plants.  
* Container plants may need **extra fertilizer** during the growing season to stay healthy.

## How to Plant Hyacinth Bulbs

Hyacinths are **cold‑climate bulbs** that require a winter chill to flower.  
In frost‑free areas, simulate this by chilling bulbs in the refrigerator:

1. Place bulbs in an **open paper bag**.  
2. Keep them **away from ripe fruit/veg**.  
3. Chill for **6–8 weeks** before planting.

Plant bulbs **directly** in their final spot—garden bed or container.

| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Spacing** | 10–15 cm apart |
| **Depth** | 10–15 cm deep |
| **Orientation** | Pointed tip facing up |
| **Cover** | Soil, then water well |
| **Moisture** | Keep moist but not soggy until shoots emerge |

## How to Grow Hyacinth

### In Containers

* Start in a **shady spot**.  
* Water weekly until shoots reach **5–10 cm** tall.  
* Then move pots to a **sunny position** to trigger blooming.

### Watering

* Water when the soil feels **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (test by finger).  
* Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
* Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilizing

If the soil was well prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is usually needed—bulbs store the energy for next year’s bloom.  
For poorer soils or a boost:

* **Slow‑release** fertilizer at the recommended rate when shoots first appear, **or**  
* **Liquid** fertilizer at the recommended rate and frequency when shoots first appear.

After flowering, feed bulbs with **blood & bone**, aged or pelletised chicken manure, then water in well.

### Bloom Time

Hyacinths typically flower in **90–120 days**.

### Deadheading & Foliage Care

* **Deadhead** or cut flowers regularly to redirect energy to the bulb.  
  * Use sharp secateurs or snips.  
  * Cut flowers with the longest stems for picking, or snap off dead blooms.  
* Let foliage **die back naturally** after flowering; the bulb reabsorbs nutrients.  
* Once all leaves have browned, trim them at ground level with sharp tools.

### Container vs. Ground

* **Container bulbs** are usually treated as **annuals** and discarded after flowering.  
* In **cold climates**, leave bulbs in the ground to naturalise.  
* In **frost‑free climates**, lift bulbs, chill them, then replant for repeat flowering.

## Bulb Handling

1. **Lift** bulbs with a garden fork, being careful not to damage them.  
2. **Prune** any dead leaves still attached.  
3. **Store** in a cool, dry place on a wire rack or in a netted bag for airflow.  
4. Ideal storage temperature: **≈ 20 °C**.  
5. Avoid hot temperatures (> 30 °C) which can reduce viability.  
6. Replant the following season following the planting chart above.

## Common Problems When Growing Hyacinth

| Problem | Symptoms | Management |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose<br>• Use soap or alcohol spray<br>• Encourage predatory insects |
| **Rotten bulbs/corms** | Bulbs show rot, lack roots/shoots, or produce stunted yellow leaves with no flowers. | • Plant in well‑drained soil, raised beds, or containers<br>• Do not water while dormant<br>• Lift and store if climate requires |
| **Slugs & snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves/shoots, leaving slimy trails, mainly at night. | • Remove hiding places<br>• Keep free‑range poultry<br>• Use traps or torchlight collection |
| **Thrips** | Tiny black/beige/white insects (<1.5 mm) with larvae that suck leaf/petal tissue, leaving small white or transparent marks. | • Wash with a garden hose<br>• Encourage predatory mites & lacewings via companion planting<br>• Spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil |
