## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Butterfly bush thrives in *full sun* – aim for **at least 6 hours of direct light per day**.  
- **Location:** Since it’s a perennial, pick a **permanent spot** where the plants won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs **well‑drained, organic‑rich soil**.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, loosen the soil, and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
  - *Tip:* For more on soil prep, see the linked guide.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Butterfly bush can grow in pots.  
  - Choose a container **recommended for container growing** and use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Minimum size: **20 L** to accommodate mature plants.  
  - Container plants often need extra fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Butterfly Bush Seeds

1. **No pre‑treatment needed** – seeds can be sown straight away.  
2. **Seed‑raising**  
   - Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots filled with a **good quality seed‑raising mix** or soil starter pellets.  
3. **Sowing depth** – plant seeds **1 mm deep**.  
4. **Moisture** – keep the soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
5. **Germination** – expect **14–28 days** at a soil temperature of **18–25 °C**.  
6. **Transplanting** – move seedlings outdoors once they develop their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
7. **Spacing** – plant at **80 cm intervals** to give each plant room to grow.  

> **Patience is key.** Butterfly bush seeds can be slow to germinate, so stick to the depth and temperature guidelines for the best results.

## How to Grow Butterfly Bush

- **Watering**  
  - Once established, the plant is *drought‑tolerant* and prefers **dry, well‑drained soil**.  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings; check by scratching 10 cm below the surface.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
  - *More on watering:* see the linked resource.  
- **Fertilizing**  
  - Thrives in *nutrient‑poor* soils; **no extra fertilizer** is needed during the growing season.  
- **Bloom Time**  
  - Flowers in roughly **125 days**.  
- **Pruning**  
  - After flowering, trim back to tidy the plant and stimulate vigorous new growth.  
  - Use sharp secateurs or snips to cut stems just above a set of lower leaves.

## Common Problems When Growing Butterfly Bush

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Why It Happens | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants | Feeding damage and honeydew production | • Spray with a garden hose<br>• Use soap or alcohol spray<br>• Encourage natural predators |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._) | Brown to orange raised spots or patches on foliage | Spread by wind or water; thrives at 10–20 °C with high humidity | • Space plants to avoid overcrowding<br>• Provide full sun<br>• Avoid over‑fertilizing<br>• Remove dead material and practice crop rotation |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that expand to cover leaves | Fungal spores reproduce on leaf surfaces | • Water at soil level, not on leaves<br>• Ensure good airflow<br>• Remove affected leaves<br>• Apply fungicide or homemade spray if needed |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves, leaving slimy trails (mostly at night) | Prefer moist environments and tender foliage | • Remove hiding places<br>• Keep free‑range poultry<br>• Use torchlight to spot them<br>• Set traps or use natural deterrents |
