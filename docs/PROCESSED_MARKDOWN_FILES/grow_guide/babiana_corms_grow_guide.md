## 1. Preparation – Get the Soil Ready

- **Sunlight:** Pick a spot that gets **at least 6 h of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil type:** Aim for a **loose, well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - *Tip:* Dig the soil to a spade’s depth, then mix in aged animal manure or compost.  
  - This lightens heavy clay and lets roots breathe.  
- **Weed control:** Clear the area of weeds **before** planting; keep it weed‑free until the corms are in.  


### Container Growing

- If you’re using pots, choose one **recommended for container growing**.  
- Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and ensure the pot holds at least **20 L**.  
- Container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the growing season.

## 2. Planting the Babiana Corms

1. **Plant directly in their final spot**—no transplanting later.  
2. **Spacing & depth:**  
   - Place each corm **10 cm apart** and **10 cm deep**.  
   - Point the tip **upwards**.  
3. **Cover & water:**  
   - Fill in with soil and water **well**.  
   - Keep the soil **moist but not soggy** until shoots appear.

## 3. Growing & Care

### Watering

- Check the soil **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid** wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
  - *More on watering:* [Learn more about watering](#).

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually means no extra fertilizer is needed.  
- If the soil is poor or you want a boost:  
  - **High‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertilizer works best.  
  - **Options:**  
    - *Slow‑release* at the first shoot emergence, **or**  
    - *Liquid* at the same time.  
- After flowering, feed with **blood & bone** or **aged/pelletised chicken manure** and water well.

### Flowering Timeline

- Expect blooms in **120–180 days**.

### Deadheading & Cutting

- **Regularly remove** spent flowers to redirect energy to the bulb.  
- Use **sharp secateurs or snips**:  
  - Cut the longest stems for picking.  
  - Snap off dead blooms.  
- For cut‑flower growers:  
  - Cut the longest stems, remove lower leaves, and place stems in a clean bucket of water.  
  - *More on cutting & conditioning:* [Learn more](#).

### Foliage Management

- Let the foliage **die down naturally** after flowering.  
- The bulb reabsorbs nutrients from the leaves for next season.  
- Once all leaves are brown, trim them to ground level with sharp tools.

## 4. Winter & Summer Protection

- **Cold climates:** Cover bulbs with **heavy mulch** to shield from frost.  
- **Hot summers:** Apply a **thick mulch** to keep bulbs cool.  
- **Wet summers:** Consider lifting bulbs if they become overcrowded or need relocation.

## 5. Lifting & Storing Bulbs

- **When to lift:** In wet climates or when you need to move them.  
- **How:** Use a garden fork, lift gently, prune any dead leaves.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Keep in a **cool, dry** place on a wire rack or a netted bag.  
  - Ideal temperature: **~20 °C**.  
  - Avoid heat >30 °C to preserve viability.  
- **Replanting:** Put them back in the ground the following season, following the planting chart above.

## 6. Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Rotten bulbs/corms** | Rot, no roots/shoots, stunted yellow leaves, no flowers. | Plant in well‑draining soil, avoid water during dormancy, lift and store if needed. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves, leaving slimy trails, especially at night. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use traps, or torchlight collection. |
