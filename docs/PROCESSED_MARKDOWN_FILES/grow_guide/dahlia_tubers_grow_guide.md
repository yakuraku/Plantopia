# How to Grow Dahlia Tubers  

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Dahlia hybrid_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

---

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Choose a spot that gets **at least 3 h of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, dig to loosen, then mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Pick a variety suited for container growing.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - **Minimum size:** 40 L pot.  
  - Container plants often need **extra fertiliser** during the season.

## How to Plant Dahlia Tubers  

1. **Timing** – Wait until **all frost danger has passed**.  
2. **Storage before planting** –  
   - Remove tubers from the bag.  
   - Keep them in a cardboard box covered with **just‑damp coir, sawdust, or potting mix**.  
   - Check regularly for rot.  
3. **Planting** –  
   - Tubers can be planted **dormant, when the eyes show growth, or when shoots appear**.  
   - If shoots are damaged, trim them with a clean, sharp knife; new shoots will sprout from the eyes.  
4. **Digging** – Create a **10–15 cm deep hole**.  
5. **Placement** – Plant tuber **horizontally** with the eye or shoot pointing **upwards**.  
6. **Cover** – Add soil; **do not water** until shoots reach ~15 cm.  
7. **Support** – Place a sturdy stake beside the tuber.  
8. **Spacing** – Keep tubers **40 cm apart**.  
9. **Pest protection** – Shield shoots from slugs and snails.

## How to Grow Dahlia  

### Watering  

- **Before shoots emerge:** *Avoid watering* to prevent rot.  
- **During the season:**  
  - Water when the soil is dry **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - **Never water the leaves** to reduce fungal risk.  

### Fertilising  

- **Well‑prepared soil:** No extra fertiliser needed.  
- **Poor soil or extra boost:**  
  - Use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertiliser.  
  - **Slow‑release:** Apply at transplanting or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
  - **Liquid:** Apply during flowering or fruiting as per the product rate.  

### Support  

- Use a **stake, bamboo cane, trellis, or string** based on plant size.  
- Install support **before sowing** to avoid root disturbance.  

### Pruning & Pinching  

- **Pinch tips** (cut just above a lower leaf set) to encourage denser growth, stronger stems, and more blooms.  
- **Deadheading:** Trim fading or dead flowers just above a leaf set to boost further flowering.  

### Flowering  

- **Bloom time:** ~90–120 days.  
- **Cut‑flower care:**  
  - Cut the longest stems with sharp snips, remove lower leaves, and place stems in clean water immediately.  

### Post‑Flowering  

- **Prune** stems to half their height after flowering.  
- **Autumn pruning:** Trim to 10 cm above ground when leaves change colour.  

### Tubers Over Winter  

- **Leave in ground** if soil is very well drained.  
- **Every second year:**  
  1. Gently lift the plant with a garden fork.  
  2. Wash off excess soil.  
  3. Divide tubers with clean, sharp snips, keeping part of the old stalk and at least one eye per tuber.  
  4. Store horizontally in **just‑damp potting mix, sawdust, or coir** until replanting.

## Common Problems When Growing Dahlias  

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Grey mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Mouldy flowers and rotting fruit; spores spread by wind. | Prune affected parts, water at soil level, and apply fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Frost damage** | Leaves wilt and turn black. | Wait for frost to pass before planting; prune damaged leaves before winter. |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, and use fungicide or homemade spray if necessary. |
| **Rotten tubers** | Tubers show rot, no roots or shoots, or produce stunted yellow leaves. | Plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers; do not water until shoots emerge; lift and store over winter if heavy soils. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves and shoots, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding places, use free‑range poultry, collect by torchlight, or set traps. |
| **Thrips** | Small flying insects (<1.5 mm) with larvae that create tiny white or transparent marks on leaves and petals. | Wash with a hose, encourage predatory mites and lacewings, or spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |
