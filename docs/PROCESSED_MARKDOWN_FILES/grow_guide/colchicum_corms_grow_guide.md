# How to Grow Colchicum Corms

**Family:** Colchiceae  
**Binomial name:** _Colchicum sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Aim for *at least 3 hours of full sun* each day, or a sunny spot with some afternoon shade.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Loose, well‑drained, enriched with organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, dig to a spade’s depth, then mix in aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Heavy soils can be lightened this way so roots can grow freely.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers (optional):**  
  - Choose a variety suited to container growing.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - **Minimum size:** 10 L pot.  
  - Container plants may need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Plant Colchicum Corms

1. **Spacing & depth:** Plant each corm **10–15 cm apart** and **10 cm deep** with the pointed tip facing up.  
2. **Cover & water:** Cover with soil and water well.  
3. **Moisture:** Keep soil moist (but not waterlogged) until shoots emerge.

## How to Grow Colchicums

Colchicums have *double dormancy*:

| Season | Activity |
|--------|----------|
| Autumn | Flower on bare stems |
| Winter | First dormancy |
| Spring | Leaf growth |
| Summer | Second dormancy |

- **No watering or fertilising** is needed while dormant.

### Watering

- Water when the soil is dry about **5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil).  
- **Best times:** Early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Tip:** Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising

- **Well‑prepared soil:** Usually no extra fertiliser needed.  
- **Poor soil or extra boost:**  
  - *High‑potassium* or *flowering‑plant* fertiliser.  
  - **Options:**  
    - *Slow‑release* at the recommended rate when shoots first appear, **or**  
    - *Liquid* at the recommended rate and frequency when shoots first appear.  
- **After flowering:** Apply blood‑and‑bone, aged or pelletised chicken manure and water well.

### Flowering Time

- Expect **60–90 days** from planting to first bloom.

### Deadheading & Foliage Care

- **Deadhead** regularly with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - Cut flowers for picking with the longest stems possible, or snap off dead blooms.  
  - This redirects energy back into the bulb rather than seed production.  
- **Foliage:** Let leaves die down naturally after flowering.  
  - The bulb absorbs nutrients from the leaves for next season’s flowers.  
  - Once all foliage has browned, cut individual leaves at ground level with sharp tools.

### Longevity & Mulching

- Colchicum bulbs can stay in the ground for years—no need to lift and divide unless overcrowded or you want to relocate them.  
- **Mulch heavily** in summer to protect bulbs from extreme heat.

## Bulb Management

### When to Lift

- Wet summers, overcrowding, or relocation.

### Lifting Technique

1. Use a garden fork to gently lift bulbs, avoiding damage.  
2. Prune any dead leaves still attached.

### Storage

- Keep bulbs in a **cool, dry space** on a wire rack or a netting bag.  
- Ideal temperature: ~20 °C.  
- Avoid hot temperatures (>30 °C) which can reduce viability.  
- Replant the following season following the planting chart above.

## Common Problems When Growing Colchicum

| Problem | Symptoms | Management |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose<br>• Apply soap or alcohol spray<br>• Encourage predatory insects |
| **Rotten bulbs or corms** | Rot, no roots or shoots, stunted yellow leaves, no flowers. | • Plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers<br>• Do not water while dormant<br>• Lift and store if climate warrants |
| **Slugs & snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves and shoots, mainly at night; slimy trails. | • Remove hiding places<br>• Keep free‑range poultry<br>• Collect by torchlight or use traps |
