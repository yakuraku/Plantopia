## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Aim for **at least 3 hours of full sun** each day. Partial shade works, but full sun gives the best blooms.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Choose a **loose, well‑drained** mix.  
  - Work in **aged animal manure or compost** to add organic matter.  
  - For heavy soils, dig in organic material to lighten it so roots can grow freely.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Use a pot that’s **≥ 20 L** for mature plants.  
  - Fill with a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Container plants may need a bit more fertilizer during the growing season.

## Growing & Care

### Watering  
- Check the soil **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilizing  
- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra feed.  
- If soil is poor or you want a boost:  
  - *Slow‑release* fertilizer at the first shoot emergence, **or**  
  - Liquid fertilizer at the same time.  
- After flowering, feed with **blood & bone** or aged/pelletised chicken manure, then water well.

### Flowering  
- Expect **120–180 days** from planting to first blooms.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: use sharp secateurs or snips to cut the longest stems, or snap off faded flowers.  
- For cut‑flower use:  
  - Cut the longest stems possible.  
  - Remove lower leaves.  
  - Place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.  

### Foliage Management  
- Let the foliage **die back naturally** after flowering; the bulb reabsorbs nutrients.  
- Once all leaves are brown, trim them at ground level with sharp tools.

### Longevity & Mulching  
- Bulbs can stay in the ground for years—no need to lift and divide.  
- **Mulch heavily** during hot summer months to protect from heat.  
- In wet summers or if overcrowded, lift bulbs to relocate or rejuvenate.

### Lifting & Storage  
1. Use a garden fork to gently lift bulbs, avoiding damage.  
2. Prune any dead leaves still attached.  
3. Store in a **cool, dry** place (≈ 20 °C) on a wire rack or netting bag for airflow.  
4. Avoid temperatures **> 30 °C** to maintain viability.  
5. Re‑plant the following season following the planting chart above.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap/alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Rotten bulbs/corms** | Bulbs show rot, lack roots/shoots, or produce stunted yellow leaves without flowers. | Plant in free‑draining soil or raised beds; avoid watering during dormancy; lift and store if needed. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Tender leaves and shoots eaten, slimy trails left behind. | Remove hiding spots, keep poultry, use traps, or spot‑treat with safe slug deterrents. |
