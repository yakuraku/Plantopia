# How to Grow Broccoli Seeds

**Family:** Brassicaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Brassica oleracea_  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Broccoli loves *full sun* – aim for at least **6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Soil:** Choose a well‑drained bed rich in organic matter.  
  1. Weed thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging or turning.  
  3. Mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  4. Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

## How to Sow Broccoli Seeds

Broccoli seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification needed.  
You can **direct‑sow** or start **seedlings** in trays and transplant later.

### Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **5 mm** deep, **35–45 cm** apart, with rows **40–60 cm** apart. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist** but never *wet* or *dry*. |
| 3 | Germination takes **3–7 days** at a soil temperature of **8–30 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and weather until they’re established. |

### Raising Seedlings

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a high‑quality seed‑raising mix (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **5 mm** deep. |
| 3 | Maintain moist soil (never wet or dry). |
| 4 | Germinate in **3–7 days** at **8–30 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm** tall. |
| 6 | Space plants **35–45 cm** apart, rows **40–60 cm** apart. |

> **Tip:** Broccoli is a cool‑season crop. Avoid sowing or transplanting in very hot weather to prevent bolting.

## How to Grow Broccoli

### Watering

- Water when the soil is dry **≈ 5 cm** below the surface (check by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
- **Deeply** water in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid** wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  *(Learn more about watering here.)*

### Fertilising

- If the soil is well‑prepared, **no extra fertiliser** is usually needed.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use:

  * **Slow‑release fertiliser** at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings are **5–10 cm** tall.  
  * **Liquid fertiliser** at the recommended rate/frequency when plants are forming heads.

  - **Head‑forming types:** Use a balanced fertiliser or one for fruit & veg.  
  - **Leaf types:** Use a high‑nitrogen fertiliser or one for leafy greens/herbs.

## How to Harvest Broccoli

- **Harvest window:** **60–120 days** after sowing.

### Head‑forming Types

- Heads are ready when fully grown but **before any flowers open**.  
- Cut the head with **10–15 cm** of stem.  
- Plants will keep producing side shoots after the first harvest.  
- Store heads in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
- For long‑term storage, blanch then freeze.

### Leaf Types

- Harvest when fully grown and before flowering.  
- Cut whole plants just above soil level.  
- Consume leaves and stems soon after harvesting.  
- Store short‑term in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
- For long‑term storage, pickled leaves and stems are a tasty option.

## Common Problems When Growing Broccoli

Broccoli can face a few pests, diseases, and other issues. Below are the most common, with quick fixes.

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Cabbage Moth / Cabbage White Butterfly** | White/grey wings with markings; caterpillars create holes or skeletonise leaves. | Use netting or decoys to deter. Pick caterpillars or apply targeted spray. *(Read more here.)* |
| **Heads Not Forming** | Often due to warm weather or slow growth, inadequate water/nutrients. | Ensure a head‑forming variety. Grow in autumn/spring in warm climates. Water regularly and fertilise with compost or fertiliser. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed production. | Avoid sowing until after frost danger or in very hot weather. Water deeply during heat to reduce stress. |
| **Bitter Taste** | Slow growth, setbacks, or late harvest. | Enrich soil with aged manure, water deeply and regularly, harvest young and tender. |
| **Hollow Stems** | Warm weather or excess nitrogen. | Grow in cooler seasons; avoid high‑nitrogen fertilisers. Stems are edible if not rotten. |
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots/undersides. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap/alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. *(Read more here.)* |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide or homemade spray if needed. *(Read more here.)* |
| **Possums, Birds, Other Animals** | Can destroy harvest overnight. | Use netting or cages; try homemade sprays (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Cutworms** | Moth larvae in soil, 3–4 cm long, chew stems of seedlings. | Remove by hand at night or use cardboard collars to protect stems. |
