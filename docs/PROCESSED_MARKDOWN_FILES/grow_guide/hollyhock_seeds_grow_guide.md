# How to Grow Hollyhock Seeds

**Family:** Malvaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Alcea rosea_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial (often grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Hollyhocks thrive in *full sun*. Pick a spot that gets at least **6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Longevity:** They’re short‑lived perennials (2–5 years). Choose a *permanent location* where the plants won’t be disturbed by digging or heavy foot traffic.  
- **Self‑seeding:** Hollyhocks often drop seed at season’s end. If you want new plants to appear, leave the area open. If you’d rather keep the garden tidy, *deadhead* before seed drop or grow them in containers.  
- **Soil:** Needs *well‑drained* soil rich in organic matter.  
  1. Weed thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  3. Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  4. Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

## How to Sow Hollyhock Seeds

Hollyhock seeds are simple to start—no soaking or stratification needed.

1. **Containers:** Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots filled with a high‑quality seed‑raising mix (or soil starter pellets).  
2. **Sowing depth:** Drop seeds **6 mm** deep.  
3. **Moisture:** Keep soil *moist but never soggy or dry*.  
4. **Germination:** Seeds sprout in **10–14 days** at a soil temperature of **18–28 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting:** Move seedlings outdoors once they develop their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing:** Plant in the garden **40 cm apart**.

**Tip:** If you prefer a quick start, try the *scatter seed* method:  
- Roughen the soil surface.  
- Sprinkle seeds evenly.  
- Lightly cover with soil.

## How to Grow Hollyhock

### Watering

- **When to water:** Check the soil 5 cm below the surface; if it feels dry, it’s time.  
- **Best times:** Early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid leaf wetness:** Water at the base to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil:** Usually no extra fertilizer needed.  
- **Boosting growth:** In poorer soils or for extra vigor, use a high‑potassium or flowering‑plant fertilizer.  
  - **Slow‑release:** Apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
  - **Liquid:** Use during flowering or fruiting, following the recommended rate and frequency.

### Support

- As they grow, hollyhocks may need help.  
- Use a **stake**, **bamboo cane**, **trellis**, or **string lines**.  
- Install support *before* sowing or transplanting to avoid root disturbance.

### Flowering

- Expect blooms in **150–200 days** after planting.

### Deadheading

- Regularly remove spent flowers to encourage more blooms.  
- Use sharp secateurs or snips to cut entire stems at ground level.

### Perennial Care

- To keep hollyhocks as perennials:  
  1. Cut flower stems to ground level after blooming.  
  2. Prune all dead foliage in winter.

## Common Problems When Growing Hollyhock

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Handle |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Armyworms, cutworms, caterpillars** | Buds or flowers eaten; petals missing; seeds destroyed. | Inspect plants; remove caterpillars by hand. Use insect‑exclusion netting or spray with Dipel if needed. |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._) | Brown to orange raised spots or patches on leaves. | Space plants to avoid overcrowding. Ensure full sun. Avoid over‑fertilizing. Remove infected material and practice crop rotation. | 
| **Slugs & snails** | Slimy trails on tender leaves and shoots, especially at night. | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, use traps, or spot‑treat with safe slug baits. |
