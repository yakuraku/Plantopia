# How to Grow Collards Seeds

**Family:** Brassicaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Brassica oleracea_  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Collards thrive in **full sun** – aim for at least **6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Soil:** Choose a **well‑drained** bed rich in organic matter.  
  - *Weed* the area thoroughly.  
  - *Loosen* the soil by digging or turning.  
  - Add **aged animal manure** or **compost** to boost fertility.  
- Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
- For more on soil prep, see the guide on **preparing soil for planting**.

## How to Sow Collards Seeds

Collards don’t need any special pre‑treatment (no soaking or stratification).  
You can **direct‑sow** in the garden or **raise seedlings** in trays and transplant later.

### Direct Sowing

1. **Plant** seeds **5 mm deep**.  
2. Space seeds **80 cm apart**; keep rows **100 cm apart**.  
3. **Moisture:** Keep soil consistently moist—never soggy or dry.  
4. **Germination:** 3–7 days at **8–30 °C**.  
5. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raising Seedlings

1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **high‑quality seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets).  
2. Sow seeds **5 mm deep**.  
3. Maintain **consistent moisture**—never wet or dry.  
4. Germination takes **3–7 days** at **8–30 °C**.  
5. **Transplant** when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Plant out** at the same spacing: **80 cm between plants, 100 cm between rows**.

> **Tip:** Collards are a cool‑season crop. Avoid sowing or transplanting when temperatures are very high to prevent premature bolting.

## How to Grow Collards

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil moisture **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the **early morning** or **late afternoon**.  
  - **Avoid** wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - For more on watering, see the guide on **watering**.

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is well‑prepared, no extra fertilizer is needed.  
  - In poorer soils or for a boost, use a **high‑nitrogen** or leafy‑green‑specific fertilizer.  
    - **Slow‑release:** Apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid:** Follow the recommended rate and frequency throughout the season.

## How to Harvest Collards

- **Harvest window:** **60–80 days** after sowing.  
- **When ready:** Leaves are large enough to eat.  
- **Method:** Cut the outer leaves at the base, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
- **Storage:**  
  - *Short‑term:* Place leaves in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - *Long‑term:* Chop, blanch, then freeze.

## Common Problems When Growing Collards

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Prevention & Control |
|---------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **Cabbage Moth / Cabbage White Butterfly** | White/grey wings with markings; caterpillars create holes or skeletonise leaves. | Use netting or decoys to keep them out. Pick caterpillars off or apply a targeted spray. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set. | Avoid sowing until after frost danger or in very hot weather. Water deeply during heat to reduce stress. |
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap/alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread to cover leaves. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, and use a suitable fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Possums, Birds & Other Animals** | Can destroy a harvest overnight. | Use netting or cages; try homemade sprays (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Cutworms** | Moth larvae in soil; 3–4 cm long, white/grey/brown; chew through tender stems. | Hand‑pick at night or use cardboard collars to protect seedlings. |
