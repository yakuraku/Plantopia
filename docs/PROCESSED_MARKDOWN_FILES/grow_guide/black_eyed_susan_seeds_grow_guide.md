**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Rudbeckia hirta_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation  
Black‑eyed Susan is a hardy perennial that thrives when left undisturbed.  
- **Choose a permanent spot** where the plants won’t be dug up year after year.  
- **Sunlight:** Full sun or part shade; aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed the area thoroughly, then **dig over** to loosen the soil.  
  - Add **aged animal manure or compost** to boost fertility.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  

> *Tip:* A healthy, weed‑free bed sets the stage for vigorous growth.

## How to Sow Black‑Eyed Susan Seeds  
These seeds are simple—no soaking or stratification needed.  
1. **Start indoors** (optional) 6 weeks before the last frost in cool climates.  
2. **Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots** filled with a high‑quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
3. **Plant seeds 1 mm deep**.  
4. **Keep soil moist**—never soggy or dry.  
5. **Germination:** 7–14 days at 20–22 °C.  
6. **Transplant** when seedlings have their first true leaves and are 5–10 cm tall.  
7. **Spacing:** 30 cm between plants in the garden.  

> *Pro tip:* Transplanting early gives seedlings a head start on the growing season.

## How to Grow Black‑Eyed Susan  
### Watering  
- **Check soil moisture** 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal risk.  

### Fertilizing  
- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
- If soil is poor or you want a boost:  
  - **High‑potassium** or flowering‑plant fertilizer works best.  
  - **Slow‑release**: apply at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
  - **Liquid**: apply during flowering or fruiting, following label rates.  

### Flowering & Deadheading  
- **Bloom time:** 95–110 days after transplant.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: snip fading or dead flowers just above a leaf set.  
  - This encourages more blooms.  

### Cutting for Flowers  
- Use sharp snips or secateurs.  
- Cut the **longest stems** possible, remove lower leaves, and place stems in clean water immediately.  

### Winter Care  
- Plants may die back in cold weather.  
- **Cut back** to just above ground in late autumn, or prune dead foliage when new growth appears in spring.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes  

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | - Spray with a garden hose.<br>- Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>- Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | - Water at soil level, not on leaves.<br>- Remove and destroy affected leaves.<br>- Avoid overcrowding for airflow.<br>- If persistent, use homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Tender leaves and shoots eaten at night, leaving slimy trails. | - Remove hiding places.<br>- Keep free‑range poultry.<br>- Spot‑collect at night or use traps. |
