## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Choose a spot that gets **at least 3 hours of full sun** each day. Cabbage can tolerate some shade, but full sun gives the best head quality.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Remove weeds, loosen the soil, and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.

## How to Sow Cabbage Seeds

Cabbage seeds are straightforward—no soaking or stratification needed. You can **direct‑sow** or **raise seedlings** first.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Depth & Spacing** | Sow 5 mm deep, 25–60 cm apart. Rows should be 40–60 cm apart. |
| **Moisture** | Keep soil **moist but never waterlogged**. |
| **Germination** | 3–7 days at 8–30 °C. |
| **Protection** | Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Containers** | Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets. |
| **Depth** | 5 mm deep. |
| **Moisture** | Same rule: moist but not soggy. |
| **Germination** | 3–7 days at 8–30 °C. |
| **Transplant Timing** | When seedlings have their first true leaves and are 5–10 cm tall. |
| **Planting Out** | Space 25–60 cm apart, rows 40–60 cm apart. |

> **Tip:** Cabbage is a cool‑season crop. Avoid sowing or transplanting when temperatures are consistently above 30 °C to prevent bolting.

## Growing Cabbage

### Watering

- **When to Water:** Check 5 cm below the surface—if dry, water.  
- **Method:** Water deeply in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
- **Avoid:** Wetting leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- *Learn more about watering here.*

### Fertilising

- **Base Soil:** If well‑prepared, no extra fertiliser is needed.  
- **Boosting Nutrition:**  
  - *High‑nitrogen* or leafy‑green‑specific fertilisers help.  
  - **Slow‑release:** Apply at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
  - **Liquid:** Follow the recommended rate and frequency during the season.

## Harvesting Cabbage

- **Timeframe:** 50–140 days after sowing.  
- **Head Formation:** Harvest when the head is tight and leaves are packed. Cut at ground level.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Short‑term: Refrigerate.  
  - Long‑term: Ferment or pickle.  
- **Non‑Head Varieties:** Harvest large leaves individually or cut the whole plant at ground level.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | Why It Happens | What to Do |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| **Bitter Taste** | Slow growth, setbacks, or late harvest. | Enrich soil with aged manure, water deeply and regularly, harvest young and tender. |
| **Bolting** | Extreme heat or sudden temperature shifts. | Wait until frost danger is over, avoid hot weather, keep plants well‑watered. |
| **Cabbage Moth / Cabbage White Butterfly** | Eggs on leaf undersides; caterpillars eat leaves. | Use netting or decoys, hand‑pick caterpillars, apply targeted spray if needed. *Read more about cabbage moth and cabbage white butterfly here.* |
| **Heads Not Forming** | Warm weather, slow growth, lack of water or nutrients. | Confirm you’re growing a head‑forming type, plant in cooler seasons, water regularly, add compost or fertiliser. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Nighttime feeders leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep poultry, use traps or torchlight collection. *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insects that swarm. | Hose down or spray with soap; destroy heavily infested plants; attract beneficial predators. *Read more about managing whitefly here.* |
