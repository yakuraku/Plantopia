# How to Grow Capsicum Seeds

**Family:** Solanaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Capsicum spp._  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Capsicum loves *full sun* – aim for at least **6 hours a day**.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Choose a well‑drained bed rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen with a fork, and mix in aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Tip:* A good quality potting mix works great for containers; choose a pot **≥40 L** for mature plants.  
- **Containers:** If you’re growing in pots, pick a variety suited to container life, use a high‑quality mix, and remember that container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Capsicum Seeds

Capsicum seeds are *straightforward* – no soaking or stratification required.

### 1. Sow Directly in the Garden

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Plant seeds **5 mm deep** and **40–60 cm apart**; rows **60–100 cm** apart. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but never water‑logged**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–21 days** at **22–35 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raise Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain moist soil (never wet or dry). |
| 4 | Germinate in **7–21 days** at **22–35 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **40–60 cm** apart, rows **60–100 cm** apart. |

> **Frost Alert:** Capsicum is frost‑sensitive. Never transplant or sow outdoors until the danger of frost has passed.  
> **Indoor Start (Cool Climates):** Sow indoors **6 weeks** before the last expected frost in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Capsicum

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil feels dry **5 cm** below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilising:**  
  - If soil is already well‑prepared, extra fertiliser isn’t usually needed.  
  - For a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at transplant or when seedlings are **5–10 cm** tall.  
    - **Liquid** fertilizer during fruiting or flowering, following the recommended rate and frequency.  
- **Support:**  
  - Stake or trellis each plant.  
  - Tie stems gently with twine or plant ties as they grow.  
  - Set up support **before** sowing or transplanting to avoid disturbing roots.  
- **Growth Habit:**  
  - Capsicum can be grown as **annuals** or **short‑lived perennials**.  
  - In tropical/subtropical zones, they fruit year‑round.  
  - In temperate zones, treat them as warm‑season annuals.  
  - To keep perennials alive in cooler climates: grow in a sheltered spot, protect from frost, or overwinter by potting up, pruning hard in early winter, and removing damaged foliage in spring.

## How to Harvest Capsicum

- **Timing:** Fruits are ready in **60–100 days**.  
- **Readiness:** Firm, glossy skin; colour change is optional.  
- **Method:** Cut with snips or scissors, leaving **~3 cm** of stem.  
- **Harvesting Frequency:** Pick regularly to encourage more fruit.  
- **Storage:**  
  - *Short term:* Room temperature.  
  - *Extended:* Refrigerate.  
  - *Long term:* Bake and freeze or preserve in oil.

## Common Problems When Growing Capsicum

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Handle |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Queensland Fruit Fly** *(Bactrocera tryoni)* | Eggs in fruit; rot from inside; premature fruit drop; larvae visible when cut open. | Dispose of fallen fruit, use insect‑exclusion netting, install traps. |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insects on leaf undersides; yellowing leaves, wilting, slowed growth. | Hose spray, soap spray, attract beneficial insects; destroy badly affected plants. |
| **Blossom End Rot** | Dark, hard discoloration from the bottom up; caused by calcium deficiency and inconsistent watering. | Discard affected fruit, water regularly and evenly, correct soil pH and nutrients. |
| **Sunscald** | White marks or blisters on fruit, often mounded; young, unripe fruit most at risk. | Avoid pruning leaves during peak summer; use light fabric shade on hot days. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; reduces yield. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Possums, Birds, Other Animals** | Can destroy a large harvest overnight. | Use netting or cages; try homemade sprays (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium Wilt** | Soil‑borne fungi; wilting, drying, yellowing leaves; no cure. | Choose resistant varieties, dispose of infected plants and soil, practice good hygiene and crop rotation. |
| **Cutworms** | Moth larvae in soil; chew through tender stems at night. | Hand‑pick at night, use cardboard collars to protect seedlings. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Brown, scab‑like spots on leaves and flowers; premature drop. | Water at soil level, discard fallen debris, rotate crops. |
