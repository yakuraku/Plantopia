# How to Grow Mizuna Seeds

**Family:** Brassicaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Brassica juncea var. japonica_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Mizuna thrives in *full sun* – aim for at least **6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Choose a *well‑drained* bed rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen the soil, and mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Tip:* For container growers, pick a variety labeled “container‑friendly” and use a **10‑litre** pot or larger.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Remember that container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Mizuna Seeds

Mizuna seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification required.  
You can either **direct‑sow** or **raise seedlings** before transplanting.

### Direct Sowing

1. **Depth & Spacing** – Sow 6 mm deep, 20–30 cm apart; rows 20–30 cm apart.  
2. **Moisture** – Keep soil *moist but never waterlogged*.  
3. **Germination** – 6–12 days at 7–25 °C.  
4. **Protection** – Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raising Seedlings

1. **Containers** – Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sowing** – 6 mm deep.  
3. **Moisture** – Same as direct sowing.  
4. **Germination** – 6–12 days at 7–25 °C.  
5. **Transplanting** – Move seedlings when they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing** – 20–30 cm between plants, rows 20–30 cm apart.

> **Cool‑season note:** Mizuna bolts in hot weather. Avoid sowing or transplanting when temperatures are consistently above 25 °C.

> **Scatter‑seed tip:** Roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil for a quick, informal planting method.

## How to Grow Mizuna

- **Watering**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface; water when it feels dry.  
  - Water *deeply* in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- **Fertilising**  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra fertiliser.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - *Slow‑release* fertiliser at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - *Liquid* fertiliser at the recommended rate/frequency during the season.  
  - High‑nitrogen or leafy‑green‑specific blends work well.

## How to Harvest Mizuna

- **Timing:** 35–50 days after sowing.  
- **Method:**  
  - Cut or twist outer leaves just above soil level, leaving some for regrowth.  
  - Or cut the whole plant at soil level.  
- **Storage:** Keep in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.

## Common Problems When Growing Mizuna

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Why It Happens | How to Fix |
|---------|--------------------|----------------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Tiny (2–4 mm), sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; may leave honeydew and attract ants. | Warm, dry conditions; lack of natural predators. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed production. | Extreme heat or sudden temperature changes. | • Sow after frost danger.<br>• Water deeply during hot spells to reduce heat stress. |
| **Cabbage Moth / Cabbage White Butterfly** | White/grey wings with markings; caterpillars create holes or skeletonise leaves. | Eggs laid on leaf undersides. | • Use netting or decoys.<br>• Hand‑pick caterpillars.<br>• Targeted sprays if needed. |
| **Cutworms** | Moth larvae (3–4 cm) in soil, emerge at night, chew stems. | Soil‑dwelling larvae. | • Hand‑pick at night.<br>• Cardboard collars around seedlings. |
| **Animals (Possums, Birds, etc.)** | Rapid loss of foliage overnight. | Predation. | • Netting or cages.<br>• Homemade deterrent spray (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves. | Fungal spores thrive in humid, low‑airflow conditions. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves.<br>• Ensure good airflow.<br>• Remove affected leaves.<br>• Fungicide or homemade spray if necessary. |
| **Whitefly** | Small, sap‑sucking insects on leaf undersides; yellowing or wilting leaves. | Warm, dry conditions; lack of predators. | • Hose spray or soap spray.<br>• Destroy severely affected plants.<br>• Attract beneficial insects. |
