# How to Grow Microgreens Seeds

**Family:** various  
**Binomial name:** _various sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Grown as an annual  

## Preparation

Microgreens thrive in a **warm, well‑lit environment**.  
- **Indoor:** A sunny windowsill that receives a few hours of direct morning light is perfect.  
- **Grow lamp:** A wide‑spectrum light works well if natural light is limited.  
- **Outdoor:** Pick a sheltered spot—avoid strong winds and extreme heat. Protect seedlings from slugs, snails, and other pests.

## Materials

- A shallow container with drainage holes (seed tray, used fruit punnet, etc.)  
- A growing medium: seed‑raising mix, fine compost, potting mix, or coir  
- A garden mister with filtered water  

## Method

1. **Pre‑soak (optional):** For larger seeds, soak overnight in warm water to speed germination.  
2. **Layer the medium:**  
   - Fill the container **3–4 cm** deep, about three‑quarters of its height.  
   - Gently press the soil to create a flat seed bed.  
   - Moisten well—*don’t* drown it.  
3. **Seed spread:** Sprinkle seeds **evenly** across the surface. Aim for a dense but non‑touching layout.  
4. **Cover lightly:**  
   - Add a thin layer (a few millimetres) of soil over the seeds.  
   - Push larger seeds slightly downward if needed.  
   - Mist lightly, then cover with a clear lid or plastic wrap, leaving small gaps for airflow.  
5. **Light placement:**  
   - Place the container in a sunny spot or near a suitable light source.  
   - Avoid *leggy* growth by ensuring adequate light, but also protect tender seedlings from scorching.  
6. **Daily misting:**  
   - Mist at least once a day to keep the surface moist.  
   - Watch for waterlogging—this can cause rot.  
   - Germination typically occurs in **3–12 days** at temperatures **8–25 °C**.  
7. **After germination:**  
   - Remove the cover.  
   - Continue daily misting until the seedlings are ready to harvest.

## Harvesting Microgreens

- **Timing:** Harvest when the first *true leaves* appear and the seedlings are **2–6 cm** tall (usually **6–30 days** after sowing).  
- **Method:**  
  - Cut each stem with scissors just above soil level, **or** pull the entire seedling (roots and all).  
  - Wash gently in filtered water, pat dry.  
- **Tip:** Harvest promptly—microgreens wilt quickly and lose flavor after cutting.  
- **Storage:** Keep in a sealed plastic bag in the refrigerator for **1–2 days**.

## Common Problems When Growing Microgreens

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Damping Off** | Seeds fail to germinate or seedlings rot, becoming soft and mushy at the base. | Use fresh potting mix, avoid watering foliage, keep soil from becoming waterlogged. |
| **Bitter Taste** | Plants grow slowly, suffer setbacks, or are harvested too late. | Enrich soil with aged manure, water deeply and regularly, harvest when young and tender. |
