## Preparation

- **Choose the right spot**  
  - Grow as an **annual** or a **perennial**.  
  - If you want a perennial, pick a permanent location that won’t be disturbed by digging or heavy foot traffic.  

- **Sunlight**  
  - Artichokes love **full sun**: aim for **at least 6 h of direct sunlight** each day.  

- **Soil**  
  - Needs **well‑drained** soil rich in organic matter.  
  - **Weed** thoroughly, **dig** to loosen, then add **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

## How to Sow Artichoke Seeds

Artichoke seeds are simple to handle—no soaking or stratification required.  
You can **direct‑sow** in the garden or **raise seedlings** in trays and transplant later.

### Direct Sowing

1. **Plant** seeds **10 mm deep**.  
2. **Spacing**: 50 cm between plants, rows 50–80 cm apart.  
3. **Moisture**: Keep soil **moist but not soggy**.  
4. **Germination**: 5–20 days at **21–26 °C**.  
5. **Protection**: Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raising Seedlings

1. **Containers**: Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Plant** seeds **10 mm deep**.  
3. **Moisture**: Same rule—keep soil moist, never water‑logged.  
4. **Germination**: 5–20 days at **21–26 °C**.  
5. **Transplant**: When seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing**: Same as direct sowing—50 cm apart, rows 50–80 cm apart.  

> **Tip for cool climates**: Start indoors 6 weeks before the last frost. Keep them warm with plenty of natural light.

## Growing Artichokes

### Watering

- **When to water**: Check the soil 5 cm below the surface—if dry, water.  
- **Best times**: Early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid**: Spraying leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
- **Boosting**:  
  - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
  - **Liquid** fertilizer during fruiting or flowering, following the recommended rate and frequency.  

### Staking & Support

- Use a **sturdy stake**.  
- Tie stems gently with twine or plant ties.  

### Perennial Care

- After harvesting or when leaves yellow in autumn, **cut plants to ground level**.  
- Apply a **thick layer of organic mulch** around the stems to protect roots.

## Harvesting Artichokes

- **Harvest window**: 290–400 days after planting.  
- **What to pick**: The globe‑shaped flower buds (the “heads”).  
- **When ready**: Buds are full size and the bracts just begin to open.  
- **Method**: Cut with snips or secateurs, leaving **5 cm of stem** attached.  

### Post‑Harvest

- **Consume quickly** for best flavor.  
- **Short‑term storage**: Place buds in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
- **Long‑term options**:  
  - Blanch whole buds or hearts in acidulated water and freeze.  
  - Pickle or preserve hearts in oil.

## Common Problems & How to Handle Them

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose. <br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray. <br>• Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; can reduce yield. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves. <br>• Ensure good airflow. <br>• Remove affected leaves. <br>• Apply suitable fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves, leaving slimy trails, especially at night. | • Remove hiding places. <br>• Keep free‑range poultry. <br>• Collect by torchlight or use traps. |
