# How to Grow Rhubarb Seeds

**Family:** Polygonaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Rheum rhabarbarum_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot** – Rhubarb is a long‑lived perennial, so pick a location that won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Sunlight** – Aim for **at least 3 h of full sun** per day; partial shade is acceptable but less ideal.  
- **Soil** – Needs a *well‑drained* mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly.  
  - Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  - Add **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Container growing** – If you’re using pots, choose a variety suited to containers.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - **Minimum volume:** 75 L to accommodate mature plants.  
  - Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Rhubarb Seeds

Rhubarb seeds are *straightforward* – no soaking or stratification required.

### 1. Sow Directly in the Garden

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **10 mm deep** and **50–70 cm apart**; rows 70–100 cm apart. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but never soggy or dry**. |
| 3 | Germination: **7–14 days** at **20–23 °C** soil temperature. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raise Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **good seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **10 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist but not waterlogged** soil. |
| 4 | Germination: **7–14 days** at **20–23 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Plant out, spacing **50–70 cm** apart, rows **70–100 cm** apart. |

## How to Grow Rhubarb

### Watering

- **When to water:** Check the soil 5 cm below the surface; if it feels dry, it’s time.  
- **Method:** Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid:** Spraying water on the leaves to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilising

- **Well‑prepared soil:** Usually no extra fertiliser needed.  
- **If soil is poor or you want a boost:**
  - *Slow‑release*: Apply at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - *Liquid*: Use during fruiting or flowering, following the product’s recommended rate and frequency.

### Harvest Tips

- **Flower stalks:** Remove as soon as they appear to extend the harvest window.  
- **First year:** For the strongest plants, *don’t harvest stalks* in the first year.

## How to Harvest Rhubarb

- **Timing:** Stalks are ready in **100–140 days**.  
- **Selection:** Harvest the outermost stalks first, leaving some in the centre for future growth.  
- **Method:** Pull and twist gently from the base; avoid cutting the stalk.  
- **Leaves:** Dispose of in compost or green waste—*leaves are toxic*.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Short term: Store in the fridge.  
  - Long term: Can be canned or frozen.

## Common Problems When Growing Rhubarb

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Prevention & Fix |
|---------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Irregular brown spots that dry into scab‑like patches; premature leaf/flower drop. | Water at soil level, not on leaves; discard fallen leaves/fruit; practice crop rotation. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set, often after extreme weather. | Wait until after frost danger or very hot periods to sow; water deeply during heat to reduce stress. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Night‑time feeding on tender leaves/shoots, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use torchlight to spot, set traps. |
