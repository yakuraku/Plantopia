## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Rocket loves **full sun or part shade**. Pick a spot that gets at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, dig it over to loosen, then mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
  - *Tip:* For a deeper understanding of soil prep, check out our guide on preparing soil for planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Rocket can thrive in pots—just choose a variety suited for container growing.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of at least **20 L**.  
  - Remember: container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Rocket Seeds

Rocket seeds are *simple*—no soaking or stratification needed. You can plant them directly in the garden or raise seedlings first.

### 1. Direct Sowing

1. **Depth & Spacing**  
   - Sow 4 mm deep.  
   - Space plants **30–40 cm apart**; rows should be the same distance.  
2. **Moisture**  
   - Keep soil **moist but never water‑logged**.  
3. **Germination**  
   - Expect 6–10 days at a soil temperature of **15–20 °C**.  
4. **Protection**  
   - Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### 2. Raising Seedlings

1. **Setup**  
   - Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sowing**  
   - Plant 4 mm deep.  
3. **Moisture**  
   - Same rule: keep soil moist but not saturated.  
4. **Germination**  
   - 6–10 days at **15–20 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting**  
   - Move seedlings when they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Plant‑Out**  
   - Space as above: **30–40 cm apart** in rows of the same width.

> **Cool‑Season Crop** – Rocket bolts in heat. Avoid sowing or transplanting when temperatures are very warm.

> **Scatter Seed Option** – Roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil. Great for a quick, informal planting.

## How to Grow Rocket

- **Watering**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *More on watering:* see our watering guide.  

- **Fertilising**  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra fertiliser.  
  - In poorer soils or for a boost:  
    - **High‑nitrogen** or leafy‑green‑specific fertiliser works well.  
    - *Slow‑release:* apply at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - *Liquid:* use as directed throughout the season.  

- **Thinning**  
  - When seedlings are large enough, pull out weak or small ones to give each plant **30–40 cm of room**.

## How to Harvest Rocket

- **Timing:** Ready to harvest in **30–60 days**.  
- **Method:**  
  - Cut the outer leaves at the base, leaving some on the plant for regrowth.  
  - Harvest small leaves regularly to avoid bitterness and encourage new growth.  
- **After Harvest:**  
  - Consume fresh as soon as possible.  
  - For short‑term storage, keep in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.

## Common Problems When Growing Rocket

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Deal |
|---------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Aphids** | 2–4 mm sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may leave honeydew attracting ants. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage natural predators. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set, often after a heat wave. | • Sow after frost danger has passed.<br>• Water deeply during hot spells to reduce heat stress. |
| **Cabbage Moth / Cabbage White Butterfly** | White/grey wings; eggs on leaf undersides; caterpillars create holes or skeletonise leaves. | • Use netting or decoys.<br>• Hand‑pick caterpillars.<br>• Targeted sprays if needed. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves, leaving slimy trails, especially at night. | • Remove hiding spots.<br>• Keep free‑range poultry.<br>• Use torchlight to spot them or set traps. |
