# How to Grow Four 'O' Clocks Seeds

**Family:** Nyctaginaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Mirabilis sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial (grown as an annual in cool climates)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Four‑o‑clocks love *full sun* – pick a spot that gets **at least 6 h of direct sunshine** each day.  
- **Perennial Placement:** These plants live for several years. Choose a *permanent* spot and avoid digging up the area once established.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs *well‑drained* soil rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, loosen the soil, and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
- **Container Growing:**  
  - If you’re using pots, pick a variety suited to container life.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot that holds at least **10 L**.  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the season.

## How to Sow Four 'O' Clocks Seeds

Four‑o‑clocks are *easy to start*—no soaking or stratification required.

### Direct Sowing

1. **Plant** seeds **20 mm deep** and **50 cm apart**.  
2. Keep the soil **moist but not soggy**.  
3. Germination takes **7–14 days** at **20–22 °C**.  
4. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raising Seedlings First

1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix (or soil starter pellets).  
2. Sow seeds **20 mm deep**.  
3. Maintain **moist but not wet** soil.  
4. Germinate in **7–14 days** at **20–22 °C**.  
5. When seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**, transplant them.  
6. Space the transplants **50 cm apart**.

> **Tip:** Four‑o‑clocks are frost‑sensitive. Wait until *all danger of frost* has passed before sowing outdoors.  
> In cooler climates, start indoors **6 weeks before the last expected frost** in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Four 'O' Clocks

### Watering

- Water when the soil feels **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil).  
- Aim for **deep, infrequent** watering in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilizing

- If the soil is already well‑prepared, extra fertilizer isn’t usually needed.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - **Liquid** fertilizer during flowering or fruiting, following the product’s rate and frequency.

### Support

- As they grow, plants may need support.  
- Use a **stake, bamboo cane, trellis, or string lines**.  
- Install support **before sowing or transplanting** to avoid disturbing roots later.

### Flowering & Deadheading

- Flowers appear in **75–85 days**.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: snip fading or dead blooms just above a set of leaves with sharp secateurs or snips.  
- This encourages more blooms and keeps the plant tidy.

### Pruning

- After flowering ends, prune back to tidy the plant and stimulate strong new growth.  
- Cut stems just above a lower leaf set with sharp tools.

## Common Problems When Growing Four 'O' Clocks

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Handle It |
|---------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may leave honeydew attracting ants. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Invite predatory insects. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves, especially at night, leaving slimy trails. | • Remove hiding spots.<br>• Keep free‑range poultry.<br>• Collect by torchlight or use traps. |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._) | Brown to orange raised spots or patches on foliage; spreads by wind or water. | • Space plants to avoid overcrowding.<br>• Provide full sun.<br>• Avoid over‑fertilizing.<br>• Remove dead plants and practice crop rotation. |
