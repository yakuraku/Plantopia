- **Soil:**  
  - Needs **excellent drainage**.  
  - No extra manure or fertilizer is usually required.  
  - Thoroughly weed and loosen the soil before planting.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you sow.

- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a container‑friendly variety if you’re growing in pots.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - **Minimum size:** 20 L (about 5 gal) for mature plants.  
  - Container plants may need a bit more fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow American Basket Flower Seeds

These seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking or stratification needed. You can sow them straight in the garden or start seedlings in trays and transplant later.

### Sow Directly

1. **Depth & spacing:** Plant 3 mm deep, 20 cm apart.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil **moist but never soggy or dry**.  
3. **Germination:** 14–21 days at 15–20 °C.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raise Seedlings First

1. **Containers:** Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Depth:** 3 mm.  
3. **Moisture:** Same as direct sowing.  
4. **Germination:** 14–21 days at 15–20 °C.  
5. **Transplant:** When seedlings have their first true leaves and are 5–10 cm tall, move them to the garden.  
6. **Spacing:** 20 cm apart.

> **Tip:** For a quick, informal approach, try the *scatter seed* method: roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil.

## How to Grow American Basket Flower

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil is dry about 5 cm below the surface (test by scratching a bit of soil).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  
- **Fertilizer:** Thrives in nutrient‑poor soils; no extra fertilizer needed during the season.  
- **Thinning:** When seedlings are large enough to handle, pull out weak ones so plants stay ~20 cm apart.  
- **Support:** Depending on size, use a stake, bamboo cane, trellis, or string lines. Install support **before** sowing or transplanting to avoid disturbing roots.  
- **Flowering Time:** Expect blooms in about **120 days**.  
- **Deadheading:** Regularly remove faded or dead flowers just above a leaf set using sharp secateurs or snips. This encourages more blooms.

- **Cut Flowers:** For stems, cut the longest stems with sharp snips or secateurs, remove lower leaves, and place immediately in a clean bucket of water.

## Common Problems When Growing American Basket Flower

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; can cover entire leaf surface. | Water at soil level (not on leaves), improve airflow, remove affected leaves, and if needed, spray a suitable fungicide or homemade spray. *Read more here about powdery mildew here.* |
