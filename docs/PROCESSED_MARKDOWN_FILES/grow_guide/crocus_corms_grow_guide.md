# How to Grow Crocus Corms

**Family:** Iridaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Crocus sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Crocuses thrive in **full sun or part shade**. Aim for at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs to be **loose, well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - **Weed** thoroughly, then dig to a **spade’s depth** (≈ 15 cm) to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost** to lighten heavy soils and boost fertility.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Containers:**  
  - Crocuses can be grown in pots—pick a variety **recommended for container growing**.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of at least **10 L**.  
  - Container plants may need **extra fertiliser** during the growing season to stay healthy.

## How to Plant Crocus Corms

1. **Plant in final position** (garden bed or container).  
2. **Spacing & depth:**  
   - Place corms **5–10 cm apart**.  
   - Dig **7–10 cm deep** with the **pointed tip facing up**.  
3. **Cover & water:**  
   - Fill with soil and water **well**.  
   - Keep the soil **moist but not waterlogged** until shoots appear.

## Growing & Caring for Crocuses

### Watering

- Water when the soil is **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (test by finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
- **Avoid wetting the leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- *Learn more about watering here.*

### Fertilising

- If the soil was well‑prepared, **no extra fertiliser** is usually needed—corms store enough energy from last year’s growth.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium or flowering‑plant fertiliser**:  
  - **Slow‑release** at the recommended rate when shoots first emerge, **or**  
  - **Liquid** at the recommended rate and frequency when shoots first emerge.  
- After flowering, fertilise with **blood & bone, aged or pelletised chicken manure** and water well.  
- Let the foliage **die down naturally**; the corm will absorb nutrients for next season.  
- Once all leaves have browned, trim them at ground level with sharp secateurs or snips.

### Longevity & Mulching

- Crocus corms can stay in the ground for **several years**—no need to lift and divide unless overcrowded or you want to relocate them.  
- **Mulch heavily** over the corms to protect from scorching summer heat.  
- In wet summers, lifting may be advisable.

### Lifting & Storing Corms

1. Use a **garden fork** to gently lift the corms, avoiding damage.  
2. Prune any **dead leaves** still attached.  
3. Store in a **cool, dry place** on a wire rack or a netting bag that allows airflow.  
4. Ideal storage temperature: **≈ 20 °C**. Avoid temperatures **> 30 °C** as they can reduce viability.  
5. Re‑plant the following season following the planting chart above.

## Common Problems When Growing Crocus

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention / Remedy |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Rotten bulbs or corms** | No roots or shoots, stunted yellow leaves, no flowers. | Plant in **free‑draining soil**, raised beds, or containers. Do **not water while dormant**. Lift and store if your climate is wet. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Tender leaves and shoots eaten, slimy trails, especially at night. | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, use torchlight to spot, or set traps. |
