# How to Grow Strawberry Runners

**Family:** Rosaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Fragaria sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Strawberry plants thrive in *full sun*. Pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day**.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Start by **weeding** thoroughly, then **dig over** to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **pH:** Aim for a **slightly acidic** soil with a **pH of 5.4‑6.5** – the sweet spot for strawberries.  
- **Container Growing:**  
  - Choose a variety suited for containers.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - The pot should hold at least **10 L** to accommodate mature plants.  
  - Container plants often need **extra fertiliser** during the growing season.

## How to Plant Strawberry Runners

1. **Timing:** Plant runners **as soon as possible** after delivery.  
2. **Storage (if needed):** Keep runners in a **perforated plastic bag** in the fridge for a few days before planting.  
3. **Prep the runner:**  
   - Remove dead leaves and stalks.  
   - Trim any dry or shriveled roots.  
   - *Optional:* Soak in water for **1 hour** to rehydrate, but don’t leave them soaking too long to avoid rot.  
4. **Spacing:**  
   - **30 cm** between runners.  
   - **20‑30 cm** between rows.  
5. **Planting steps:**  
   1. Dig a **20 cm deep** hole and create a small **mound** in the centre.  
   2. Place the runner on the mound, spreading the roots evenly.  
   3. Cover with soil, ensuring the **growing tip** (the crown) is **level with the soil surface** and not buried.  
   4. Water in **well**.  
   5. Protect from **slugs and snails**.  
   6. In cold climates, mulch or use a **cloche** to shield from frost.  
6. **Leaf drop:** Any leaves on the runner may die back after planting as the plant uses their nutrients to establish roots. New leaves will sprout from the crown once the plant is established.

## How to Grow Strawberry Plants

- **Watering:**  
  - Keep soil **evenly moist** but never waterlogged.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  
- **Fertilising:**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, no extra fertiliser is needed.  
  - For poorer soils or a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertiliser** at transplanting or when seedlings reach **5‑10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid fertiliser** during fruiting or flowering, following the recommended rate and frequency.  
- **Mulching:**  
  - Apply **straw or sugar‑cane mulch** under ripening fruit to help prevent rot.

## How to Harvest Strawberries

- **Timing:** Fruits are ready in **140‑160 days**.  
- **Readiness:** Look for **full colour** and a **fragrant aroma**.  
- **Method:**  
  - Cut with **snips or secateurs**.  
  - Or gently twist to separate from the stem.  
- **Frequency:** Harvest **regularly** to encourage more fruit.  
- **Enjoy:** Strawberries taste best when eaten **fresh**.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Short‑term: Keep in a container in the fridge.  
  - Long‑term: Freeze or make preserves.

## Common Problems When Growing Strawberries

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Tiny (2‑4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Grey mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Mouldy flowers and rotting fruit; spores spread by wind, survive in soil or green waste. | Prune affected parts, water at soil level (not on leaves), and apply a suitable fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Armyworms, cutworms & other caterpillars** | Inside fruit, leaving small holes; can make fruit inedible. | Inspect fruit, remove caterpillars, use netting or fruit bags, or spray with Dipel if needed. |
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level, remove and destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding, and consider a homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Possums, birds & other animals** | Can destroy a large portion of the harvest overnight. | Use netting or cages, or spray with a homemade deterrent (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Slugs & snails** | Feed on tender leaves and shoots, especially at night; leave slimy trails. | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, collect by torchlight, or set traps. *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
