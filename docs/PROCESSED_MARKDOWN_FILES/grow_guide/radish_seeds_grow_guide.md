# How to Grow Radish Seeds  

**Family:** Brassicaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Raphanus sativus_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Choose a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Loose, well‑drained, enriched with organic matter.  
  - Weeding, then dig to at least a spade’s depth to loosen the soil.  
  - Add aged animal manure or compost to lighten heavy soils and feed roots.  
- **Weed control:** Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

## How to Sow Radish Seeds  

Radish seeds are *simple* to start—no soaking or stratification needed.  

1. **Direct sow** in the garden:  
   - 10 mm deep, 3–7 cm apart.  
   - Rows 20–30 cm apart.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil consistently moist—never soggy or dry.  
3. **Germination:** 3–14 days at 8–30 °C.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  

## How to Grow Radish  

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water deeply in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.

- **Thinning (optional):**  
  - When seedlings are large enough, pull out weak or small ones.  
  - Aim for 3–7 cm spacing.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
  - Over‑fertilizing can favor leaves over roots.  
  - In poor soil, use a low‑nitrogen, high‑phosphorus fertilizer (e.g., blood and bone) at the recommended rate.  

## How to Harvest Radishes  

- **Timing:** 40–60 days after sowing.  
- **Roots:**  
  - Pull gently at the leaf base or use a garden fork for multiple roots.  
  - Shake off soil, cut foliage 1–2 cm above the root.  
  - Store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - For longer storage, pickle or ferment.  
- **Leaves:**  
  - Harvest when large enough; pinch off outer leaves, leave some for regrowth.  
  - Consume soon after cutting; store short‑term in a perforated bag in the fridge.  
- **Seed pods:**  
  - Pick when young, bright green, before they become bumpy.  
  - Cut or pull individual pods.  
  - Eat fresh or pickle for long‑term storage.  

## Common Problems When Growing Radishes  

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Why It Happens | How to Fix |
|---------|--------------------|----------------|------------|
| **Cabbage moth / cabbage white butterfly** | White/grey wings with markings; caterpillars create holes or skeletonize leaves | Eggs laid on underside of leaves | Use netting or decoys; hand‑pick caterpillars; targeted sprays if needed |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed production | Extreme weather or early sowing | Wait until frost danger passes; avoid hot weather; water deeply to reduce heat stress |
| **Split roots** | Roots split or crack | Inconsistent watering when roots mature | Water deeply and evenly; consider recent rainfall before watering |
| **Tough roots** | Hard, woody texture | Harvested too late | Harvest when roots are young and tender |
| **Small roots** | Tiny, under‑developed roots | Over‑sowing or over‑fertilizing | Thin seedlings; avoid excess fertilizer to keep foliage from outcompeting roots |
| **Forked roots** | Roots split into two or more strands | Stony or heavy clay soil | Cultivate well before planting; add coarse sand or compost; choose round or short varieties for heavy soils |
