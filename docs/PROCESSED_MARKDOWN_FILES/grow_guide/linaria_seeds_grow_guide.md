# How to Grow Linaria Seeds  

**Family:** Plantaginaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Linaria maroccana_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Linaria thrives in **full sun**—pick a spot that receives **at least 6 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Self‑seeding:** These plants often drop seed at season’s end. If you *don’t* want them to spread, **deadhead** before seed set or grow them in containers.  
- **Soil:** Aim for a **well‑drained, organic‑rich** mix.  
  - Weed thoroughly.  
  - Loosen the soil by digging or turning.  
  - Add **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

## How to Sow Linaria Seeds  

Linaria seeds need no pre‑treatment (no soaking or stratification). They do best when started in trays or containers and then transplanted.

1. **Choose a starter mix** – a good quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets works well.  
2. **Plant depth:** Sow seeds **5 mm** deep.  
3. **Moisture:** Keep the soil **moist but never soggy or dry**.  
4. **Germination:** Expect **14–21 days** at a soil temperature of **20–30 °C**.  
5. **Transplant:** Move seedlings once they develop their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing:** In the garden, space plants **30 cm apart**.  

**Tip:** Linaria seeds are tiny—handle them gently to prevent loss.  
- Mix seeds with sand or fine potting mix before sowing.  
- Use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly.  
- Press lightly into the soil surface for good seed‑soil contact.

## How to Grow Linaria  

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil feels dry **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  

- **Fertilising:**  
  - If the soil is already rich, no extra fertilizer is needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertilizer:  
    - **Slow‑release:** Apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid:** Apply at the recommended rate/frequency while plants are fruiting or flowering.  

- **Flowering:** Linaria typically blooms in **≈ 70 days**.  

- **Deadheading:** Regularly trim faded or dead flowers just above a set of leaves with sharp secateurs or snips. This encourages more blooms.

- **Cut Flowers:** For bouquets, cut the longest stems with sharp snips or secateurs, remove lower leaves, and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.

## Common Problems When Growing Linaria  

Like all garden plants, Linaria can face a few common issues. Below are practical solutions for each.

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage natural predators. <br>*Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread to cover leaves; can reduce yield. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves.<br>• Ensure good airflow between plants.<br>• Remove affected leaves.<br>• If needed, spray with a suitable fungicide or homemade spray. <br>*Read more about powdery mildew here.* |
| **Root Rot** | Slow establishment, yellowing or wilted foliage, soft brown tissue at stem base and roots; often fatal. | • Reduce soil moisture.<br>• Add organic matter.<br>• Ensure mulch doesn’t touch stems.<br>• Remove and dispose of affected plants. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves and shoots, especially at night; leave slimy trails. | • Remove hiding places.<br>• Keep free‑range poultry.<br>• Use torchlight to spot them.<br>• Set traps. <br>*Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
