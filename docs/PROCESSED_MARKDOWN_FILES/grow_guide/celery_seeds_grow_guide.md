# How to Grow Celery Seeds

**Family:** Apiaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Apium graveolens_  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Celery loves **full sun to part shade**. Aim for at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:** Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  1. Weed the area thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  3. Mix in aged animal manure or compost.  
  4. Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:** Celery can thrive in pots—pick a variety suited for container growth.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Choose a pot of **at least 20 L** to accommodate mature plants.  
  - Remember: container plants often need **extra fertiliser** to stay healthy.

## How to Sow Celery Seeds

Celery seeds are tiny but mighty. No pre‑treatment (soaking, stratification) is needed.

1. **Start indoors**: Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Plant depth:** Sow seeds **3 mm** deep.  
3. **Moisture:** Keep the soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
4. **Germination:** Expect **14–21 days** at a soil temperature of **21–25 °C**.  
5. **Transplant:** Move seedlings outdoors once they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing:**  
   - Plant **20–30 cm apart**.  
   - Rows should be **30–55 cm apart**.

> **Tip:** Because the seeds are so small, mix them with a bit of sand or fine potting mix before sowing, or use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly. Press lightly into the soil to ensure good seed‑soil contact.

> **Note:** Celery bolts (flowers early) if seedlings are exposed to cool weather. Avoid sowing or transplanting in very cool temperatures.

## How to Grow Celery

- **Watering:**  
  - Keep the soil **evenly moist** but not waterlogged.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- **Fertilising:**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, no extra fertiliser is needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertiliser** at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid fertiliser** during fruiting or flowering, following the product’s recommended rate and frequency.  
- **Blanching (for tenderness):**  
  - Block light by hilling soil around the base, mulching thickly with straw, or placing opaque containers around the plant.

## How to Harvest Celery

- **Timing:** Celery is ready in **120–140 days**.  
- **Stems:** Harvest when they’re large enough to eat.  
  - Pull or twist gently from the base to separate individual stems.  
  - Leave some stems in the centre to keep the plant alive.  
  - For a whole‑plant harvest, cut at ground level.  
- **Leaf Celery:**  
  - Cut stalks and leaves as needed.  
  - Stalks are usually fibrous and discarded.  
  - Leaves are best eaten fresh but can be dried for long‑term storage.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Store fresh celery in a **perforated plastic bag** in the fridge for short‑term use.

## Common Problems When Growing Celery

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scab‑like patches; premature leaf and flower drop | Water at soil level, discard fallen debris, practice crop rotation |
| **Bitter taste** | Slow growth, late harvest, fibrous stems | Enrich soil with aged manure, water deeply and regularly, harvest early |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed production | Avoid sowing before frost danger passes; keep plants well‑watered during hot spells |
| **Damping off** | Seeds fail to germinate or seedlings rot at the base | Use fresh potting mix, avoid water on foliage, keep soil from becoming waterlogged |
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides | Water at soil level, remove affected leaves, ensure good airflow; consider homemade milk spray or fungicide |
| **Slugs & snails** | Slimy trails, tender leaf damage, mainly at night | Remove hiding spots, use free‑range poultry, set traps, or torchlight collection |
