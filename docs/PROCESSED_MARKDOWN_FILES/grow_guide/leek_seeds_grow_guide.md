# How to Grow Leek Seeds

**Family:** *Amaryllidaceae*  
**Binomial name:** _Allium porrum_  
**Life Cycle:** biennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Leeks thrive in **full sun** – aim for at least **6 hours of direct light** each day.  
- **Soil:** Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - **Weed** the area thoroughly.  
  - **Loosen** the soil by digging or turning.  
  - Add **aged animal manure** or **compost** to boost fertility.  
- Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
- *Tip:* For a deeper understanding of soil prep, see our guide on preparing soil for planting.

## How to Sow Leek Seeds

Leek seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification needed. You can sow them **directly in the garden** or **raise seedlings** in trays and transplant later.

### 1. Sow Directly

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | **Plant** seeds **5 mm** deep, **12 cm** apart, with rows **45 cm** apart. |
| 2 | **Moisture:** Keep soil consistently moist—never soggy or dry. |
| 3 | **Germination:** 10–14 days at **18–23 °C** soil temperature. |
| 4 | **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raise Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **high‑quality seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | **Plant** seeds **5 mm** deep. |
| 3 | **Moisture:** Keep soil consistently moist—never soggy or dry. |
| 4 | **Germination:** 10–14 days at **18–23 °C**. |
| 5 | **Transplant** when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm** tall. |
| 6 | **Spacing:** Plant out **12 cm** apart, rows **45 cm** apart. |

> **Scatter‑Seed Method**  
> Roughen the soil surface, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly smooth over. Great for a quick, informal start.

> **Handling Tiny Seeds**  
> Leek seeds are small—mix them with sand or fine potting mix, or use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly. Press lightly into the soil to ensure good contact. Keep them from drying out.

## How to Grow Leeks

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil is dry **≈ 5 cm** below the surface (test by scratching a bit of soil).  
  - Aim for **deep** watering in the **early morning** or **late afternoon**.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *More on watering:* see our watering guide.

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil was well‑prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertilizer** at transplant or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
    - **Liquid fertilizer** during fruiting or flowering, following the recommended rate and frequency.

- **Thinning (Optional):**  
  - When seedlings are large enough to handle, pull out weak or small ones to achieve **12 cm spacing**.

- **Blanching (Optional):**  
  - To improve tenderness and flavor, **exclude light** by hilling soil around the base, mulching thickly with straw, or placing opaque containers over the plant.  
  - *Learn more about blanching:* see our blanching guide.

## How to Harvest Leeks

- **Timing:** Leeks are ready in **120–150 days**.  
- **Method:** Gently pull the whole plant, shake off excess soil.  
- **Storage:** Keep leeks in the ground until needed. For short‑term storage, wrap in a damp paper towel, place in a perforated plastic bag, and refrigerate.

## Common Problems When Growing Leeks

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may leave honeydew attracting ants. | • Spray with a garden hose<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray<br>• Encourage predatory insects |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set, often after extreme weather. | • Sow after frost danger<br>• Water deeply during hot periods to reduce heat stress |
| **Poor Germination** | Often due to old seed; seeds may take longer than expected. | • Use fresh seed each year<br>• Note sowing date and expected germination window |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._) | Brown to orange raised spots or patches on foliage, spread by wind or water. | • Space plants to avoid overcrowding<br>• Provide full sun<br>• Avoid over‑fertilizing<br>• Remove dead plants and practice crop rotation |
| **Onion Thrips** (_Thrips tabaci_) | Tiny (≤ 1.5 mm) pale yellow to light brown insects; silver patches on leaves. | • Wash with a garden hose<br>• Spread organic mulch<br>• Encourage predatory mites and lacewings via companion planting |
