## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Rockmelons thrive in *full sun* – pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours** of direct sunshine each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Choose a well‑drained bed rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, then dig the soil to loosen it.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost** for extra nutrients.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.  
  - *Tip:* Read more about soil prep [here](#).

## How to Sow Rockmelon Seeds

Rockmelon seeds are simple to start—no soaking or stratification needed.

1. **Direct sow**:  
   - Plant 10–15 mm deep.  
   - Space **90–120 cm** between plants, **130–160 cm** between rows.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep the soil *moist but not soggy*.  
3. **Germination:**  
   - 8–16 days at **20–32 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  
5. **Frost caution:** Rockmelons are frost‑sensitive. **Never transplant or sow outdoors** until the danger of frost has passed.

## How to Grow Rockmelon

### Watering

- Water when the soil is dry **≈5 cm** below the surface (check by scratching a bit of soil).  
- **Deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering is best.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- *Learn more about watering* [here](#).

### Fertilizing

- If your soil is already well‑prepared, extra fertilizer isn’t necessary.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release fertilizer** at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm** tall.  
  - **Liquid fertilizer** at the recommended rate/frequency during fruiting or flowering.

### Support & Vining

- **Ground growth:** Allow **≥2 m²** per plant.  
- **Trellis:** Vines will climb using tendrils; add extra support with twine or plant ties.  
- **Large fruit:** Use a sling made from netting to keep fruit from crushing the vine.  
- **Set up support** *before* sowing or transplanting to avoid disturbing roots later.

### Optional Management

- **Pinch the growing tip** to control plant size and encourage side shoots that bear fruit.  
- **Mulch** under ripening fruit with straw or sugar cane to reduce rot.

## How to Harvest Rockmelon

- **Harvest window:** **100–120 days** after sowing.  
- **Signs of ripeness:**  
  - Stems become tough and woody.  
  - Leaves turn dry and brown.  
- **Method:** Cut the fruit from the vine, leaving **5–10 cm** of stem attached.  
- **Storage:** Keep in the fridge; best eaten within a few days of harvest.

## Common Problems When Growing Rockmelon

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Handle It |
|---------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose. <br>• Use soap or alcohol spray. <br>• Encourage natural predators. <br>• Read more about aphids [here](#). |
| **Not Setting Fruit** | Flowers fall off or tiny fruit shrivel and rot—often due to poor pollination. | • Wait until both male and female flowers appear. <br>• Hand‑pollinate with a paintbrush. <br>• Learn more about hand pollination [here](#). |
| **Animals (Possums, Birds, etc.)** | Rapid loss of harvest overnight. | • Use netting or cages to exclude pests. <br>• Try homemade sprays (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; can reduce yields. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves. <br>• Ensure good airflow. <br>• Remove affected leaves. <br>• Use fungicide or homemade spray if needed. <br>• Read more about powdery mildew [here](#). |
| **Sunscald** | White marks or blisters on fruit, often mounded; young, unripe fruit are most vulnerable. | • Don’t prune leaves during peak summer; they shade fruit. <br>• Cover plants with light fabric on very hot days. |
