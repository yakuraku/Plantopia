# How to Grow Spider Lily Bulbs  

**Family:** Amaryllidaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Hymenocallis x festalis_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Spider lilies thrive in *full sun* – aim for at least **6 hours of direct light** each day.  
- **Location:** Because they’re perennials, plant them in a **permanent spot** where they can grow undisturbed and form attractive clumps.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **loose, well‑drained** mix enriched with organic matter.  
  - Weeding, digging to at least a spade’s depth, and adding **well‑aged animal manure or compost** lightens heavy soils and encourages root growth.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a potting mix of good quality.  
  - The container should be **at least 20 L** to accommodate mature plants.  
  - Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season to stay healthy.  

## How to Grow Spider Lily Bulbs  

### Planting  

1. **Timing:** Plant in **spring** after the last frost.  
2. **Spacing:** Place bulbs **20–40 cm apart** to give each plant room to expand.  
3. **Depth & Orientation:**  
   - Dig a hole **10–15 cm deep**.  
   - Position the bulb with the **tip pointing upward**—this keeps the growing point dry and disease‑free.  
4. **Cover & Water:**  
   - Fill the hole with soil, tamp lightly, and water thoroughly.  

### Watering  

- Check the soil **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid wetting the leaves** to reduce fungal risk.  

### Fertilising  

- **Well‑prepared soil:** No extra fertiliser needed; bulbs store the energy required for next year’s bloom.  
- **Poor soil or extra boost:**  
  - *Slow‑release* fertiliser at the recommended rate when shoots first appear, **or**  
  - *Liquid* fertiliser at the recommended rate and frequency when shoots emerge.  
- **Post‑flowering:** Apply **blood & bone** or aged/pelletised chicken manure, then water well.  

### Flowering & Care  

- **Bloom time:** Approximately **120–180 days** after planting.  
- **Naturalised bulbs** often produce more flowers per stem than newly planted ones.  
- **Deadheading:** Remove spent flowers regularly to redirect energy back into the bulb.  
- **Foliage:** Let leaves die back naturally after flowering; the bulb will reabsorb nutrients.  
  - Once all foliage has faded, trim individual leaves at ground level with sharp secateurs or snips.  

### Winter & Summer Protection  

- **Cold climates:** Cover bulbs with a **heavy mulch** in winter to shield from frost.  
- **Hot summers:** Mulch over the bulbs to protect them from extreme heat.  
- **Longevity:** Bulbs can stay in the ground for years without lifting or dividing.  
- **Overcrowding or relocation:** Lift bulbs if they become overcrowded or you wish to move them.  

### Lifting & Storing Dormant Bulbs  

1. Use a garden fork to gently lift bulbs, avoiding damage.  
2. Prune any dead leaves still attached.  
3. Store in a **cool, dry** area on a wire rack or a netting bag that allows airflow.  
4. Ideal storage temperature: **≈20 °C**; avoid temperatures above **30 °C**.  
5. Re‑plant the following season following the planting guidelines above.  

## Common Problems When Growing Spider Lilies  

### Rotten Bulbs or Corms  
- **Cause:** Pathogens entering bulbs after sitting in cold, wet soil, temporary waterlogging, or warm winter temperatures.  
- **Symptoms:** Visible rot, no roots or shoots, stunted yellow leaves, no flowers.  
- **Prevention:**  
  - Plant in **free‑draining soil** or raised beds.  
  - Avoid watering during dormancy.  
  - Lift and store bulbs if your climate is prone to these conditions.  

### Slugs and Snails  
- **Behavior:** Feed on tender leaves and shoots, mainly at night, leaving slimy trails.  
- **Control:**  
  - Remove hiding places.  
  - Keep free‑range poultry.  
  - Spot‑check with a torch at night.  
  - Use traps or other deterrents.
