# How to Grow Rhubarb Crowns  

**Family:** Polygonaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Rheum rhabarbarum_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation  

- **Choose a permanent spot** – Rhubarb is a long‑lived perennial, so pick a location that won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Sunlight:** Full sun to part shade. Aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, then loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  - Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Container growing:**  
  - Use a container that’s **≥ 75 L** for mature plants.  
  - Choose a variety suited to containers if possible.  
  - Fill with high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Remember container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.  

## How to Plant Rhubarb Crowns  

Store crowns in damp coir or potting mix until you’re ready to plant.  

1. **Trim** any damaged leaves or roots.  
2. **Dig** a hole **20 cm deep** and create a small mound in the centre.  
3. **Place** the crown on the mound, growing point facing up and level with the soil surface.  
4. **Cover** with soil, leaving the crown tip exposed.  
5. **Space** crowns **50 cm apart**.  
6. **Water** thoroughly.  
7. Keep the soil **moist but not waterlogged** until the first stalks and leaves appear.  

## How to Grow Rhubarb  

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water deeply in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  

- **Fertilising:**  
  - If the soil was well‑prepared, no extra fertiliser is needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertiliser** at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
    - **Liquid fertiliser** at the recommended rate/frequency while plants are fruiting or flowering.  

- **Flower stalks:**  
  - *Tip:* Remove flower stalks as soon as they appear to extend the harvest.  
  - Optional: Don’t harvest stalks in the first year for the strongest plants.  

## How to Harvest Rhubarb  

- **Timing:** Ready to harvest in **100–140 days**.  
- **When to pick:** Stalks should be large enough to eat.  
- **Method:**  
  1. Harvest the outermost stalks first, leaving some in the centre for future growth.  
  2. Pull and twist gently from the base to separate.  
  3. Cut off the leaves and compost or green‑waste them.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Short term: Keep in the fridge.  
  - Long term: Can be canned or frozen.  
- **Safety:** **Do not eat rhubarb leaves** – they are toxic.  

## Common Problems When Growing Rhubarb  

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Handle |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scab‑like patches; premature leaf/flower drop | Water at soil level (not on leaves). Dispose of fallen leaves/fruit. Practice crop rotation. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed production, often after extreme weather | Avoid sowing seed until after frost danger or in very hot weather. Water deeply in hot conditions to prevent heat stress. |
| **Rotten crowns** | Crowns show rot, no roots/shoots, stunted yellow leaves | Plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers. Don’t water crowns over winter unless soil is very dry. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves/shoots, leaving slimy trails, mainly at night | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, collect by torchlight, or use traps. *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |

## Orientation  

Rhubarb crowns come in various shapes and may have visible cuts where they were separated from the parent plant. The pictures below illustrate the correct planting orientation: **growing points facing upward**.
