## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot** – Raspberries are long‑lived, so pick a location that won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Sunlight:** Aim for **at least 3 h of full sun** each day; partial shade is acceptable but will reduce yields.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly **weed** the area, then **dig over** to loosen the soil.  
  - Add **aged animal manure** or **compost** to boost fertility.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.

## How to Plant Raspberry Canes

Plant your canes **right after delivery** to keep the roots moist.

1. **Remove** canes from the bag and shake off the coir.  
2. **Soak** the roots in a bucket of water for **1–2 h** (never more than 2 h to avoid rot).  
   - Optional: add a **seaweed solution** at the recommended rate.  
3. **Space** canes **40 cm apart**.  
4. **Dig** a **30 cm deep** hole and create a small mound in the centre.  
5. **Place** the cane on the mound, spreading the roots evenly.  
6. **Cover** with soil, ensuring the **bottom of the stem** sits level with the soil surface.  
7. **Water** thoroughly after planting.  

**Optional:** Prune the cane to **20 cm above the ground** after planting to encourage root growth and new shoots.

## How to Grow Raspberry Canes

- **Support:**  
  - Install a **trellis** or sturdy support **before planting** to avoid disturbing roots later.  
  - Tie canes gently with twine or plant ties; bundling canes makes them easier to manage.  

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil moisture **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a little soil with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - **Avoid** wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If soil is already well‑prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is needed.  
  - For poorer soils or a quick boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertilizer** at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm** tall.  
    - **Liquid fertilizer** at the recommended rate and frequency during fruiting or flowering.

## How to Prune Raspberry Canes

The pruning strategy depends on your variety:

| Variety | Fruit Timing | Pruning Method |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Primocane** | Autumn (new growth) | **Prune all canes to the ground in winter**. Easy and effective. |
| **Floricane** | Summer (two‑year‑old canes) | • Mark fruiting canes with a **soft wool tie** while they’re fruiting. <br>• In winter, **cut fruited canes to the ground**. <br>• Leave new, unfruitful canes unpruned—they’ll bear next year. |

- **Seasonal pruning**: Remove weak, diseased, or damaged canes to improve airflow.  
- **Suckers**: New shoots that appear some distance from the parent can be dug up for propagation or cut below soil level to control spread.

## How to Harvest Raspberry

- **Timing**:  
  - Primocane varieties are ready in the **first autumn** after planting.  
  - Floricane varieties fruit in the **second summer** after planting.

- **When to pick**: Raspberries are ripe when they’re **firm and fully coloured**.  
- **Harvesting technique**: Gently pull the berries off the plant.  
- **Post‑harvest**:  
  - Eat them fresh or store them in a container in the fridge for a short term.  
  - For longer storage, consider **freezing**, **canning**, or making **jam/sauce**.

## Common Problems When Growing Raspberry

| Problem | Description | Quick Fixes |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Grey mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Fungal disease that rots flowers and fruit; thrives in cool, damp weather. | Prune affected parts, water at soil level, apply fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Queensland Fruit Fly** _(Bactrocera tryoni)_ | Lays eggs in fruit, causing internal rot. | Dispose of fallen fruit, use insect‑exclusion netting, install traps. |
| **Animals (possums, birds, etc.)** | Can destroy a large portion of the harvest overnight. | Use netting or cages; try homemade sprays (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium wilt** | Soil‑borne fungi that block water/nutrient flow, causing wilting and yellowing. | Choose resistant varieties, remove affected plants, practice crop rotation, maintain good hygiene. |
| **Thrips** | Tiny flying insects that suck leaf tissue, leaving white marks. | Wash plants with a hose, encourage predatory mites/lacewings, spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |
| **Spider mites** (Tetranychus urticae) | Sap‑sucking arachnids that dry and discolor leaves. | Prune for airflow, spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulphur. |
