# How to Grow Parsnip Seeds

**Family:** Apiaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Pastinaca sativa_  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial (but usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Aim for **at least 3 hours of full sun** each day, or a mix of sun and part shade.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Loose, well‑drained loam or sandy loam works best.  
  - Enrich with **aged animal manure or compost** to add organic matter.  
  - For heavy clay soils, mix in coarse sand or more compost to lighten the texture.  
- **Weeding:** Clear the area thoroughly before planting. Keep it weed‑free until the seedlings are established.  
- **Soil Test:** If you’re unsure about nutrient levels, consider a simple soil test or use a balanced organic fertilizer as a baseline.

## How to Sow Parsnip Seeds

Parsnip seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking or stratification needed.

1. **Planting depth & spacing**  
   - Sow **5 mm deep**.  
   - Space seeds **5–10 cm apart** within rows.  
   - Keep rows **35–50 cm apart** for easy access.  
2. **Moisture**  
   - Keep the soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
3. **Temperature & Germination**  
   - Germination takes **14–28 days** at **10–21 °C**.  
   - Patience pays off—slow germination is normal.  
4. **Protection**  
   - Shield young seedlings from pets, pests, and harsh weather until they’re sturdy.

> **Tip:** If you’re using a slow‑germinating variety, double‑check the seed packet for the expected germination window and stick to the depth and temperature guidelines.

## How to Grow Parsnips

- **Watering**  
  - Test soil moisture by scratching a small area with your finger; water when it’s dry **≈5 cm below the surface**.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon to reduce evaporation.  
  - Avoid wetting the foliage to prevent fungal diseases.  
- **Thinning**  
  - Once seedlings are large enough to handle, thin them to **5–10 cm spacing**. Pull out weaker ones to give the remaining plants room to grow.  
- **Fertilizing**  
  - If the soil is already rich, skip extra fertilizer.  
  - Over‑fertilizing can lead to lush leaves but poor root development.  
  - In poorer soils, use a **low‑nitrogen, high‑phosphorus** mix (e.g., blood and bone) at the recommended rate.  

## How to Harvest Parsnips

- **Timing:** Roots are ready in **120–140 days**.  
- **Method:**  
  1. Gently pull at the base of the leaves or use a garden fork to lift roots.  
  2. Shake off excess soil.  
  3. Trim the foliage **1–2 cm above** the root.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Keep in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge for short‑term use.  
  - For longer storage, blanch the roots and then freeze.

## Common Problems When Growing Parsnips

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Why It Happens | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Poor germination** | Seeds fail to sprout | Old seed, wrong temperature | Use fresh seed, note sowing date, keep soil at 10–21 °C |
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Brown, scab‑like spots on leaves | Bacterial infection | Water at soil level, remove fallen debris, rotate crops |
| **Whitefly** | Yellowing or wilting leaves, clouds of insects on undersides | Sap‑sucking pest | Hose off or spray with soap, attract beneficial insects |
| **Carrot fly (Psila rosa)** | Larvae burrow into roots | Eggs laid on seedlings | Companion planting, insect netting |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering, seed production | Extreme weather or late sowing | Sow after frost danger, water deeply during heat |
| **Forked roots** | Roots split into two | Stony or heavy soil | Cultivate well, add coarse sand or compost, choose short varieties |
| **Split roots** | Roots break or split | Inconsistent watering | Water deeply and evenly, consider rainfall |
| **Tough roots** | Roots hard and woody | Harvested too late | Harvest when roots are young and tender |
| **Small roots** | Tiny, under‑developed roots | Over‑sowing or over‑fertilizing | Thin seedlings, avoid excess fertilizer |

> **Pro Tip:** Regularly inspect seedlings for early signs of pests or disease. Early intervention saves the crop and keeps your garden thriving.
