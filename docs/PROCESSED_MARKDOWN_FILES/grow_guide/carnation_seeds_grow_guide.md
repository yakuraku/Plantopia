# How to Grow Carnation Seeds

**Family:** Caryophyllaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Dianthus caryophyllus_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Carnations thrive in **full sun** – aim for at least **6 hours of direct light** each day.  
- **Location:** As a perennial, give them a **permanent spot** where they won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly **weed**, **dig** to loosen, and add **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, choose a variety **recommended for container use**.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of at least **10 L**.  
  - Container plants often need **extra fertiliser** during the growing season.

## How to Sow Carnation Seeds

Carnation seeds are simple to start – no soaking or stratification required.

1. **Seed trays:** Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets).  
2. **Sowing depth:** Sprinkle seeds **6 mm** deep.  
3. **Moisture:** Keep the soil **moist but not soggy**.  
4. **Germination:** Seeds should sprout in **7–14 days** at a soil temperature of **18–22 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting:** Move seedlings outdoors once they develop their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing:** When planting in the garden, space plants **30–50 cm** apart.

## How to Grow Carnations

### Watering

- Water when the soil feels **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
- Aim for **deep watering** in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising

- If the soil is already well‑prepared, **no extra fertiliser** is needed.  
- For poorer soil or a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release** high‑potassium or flowering‑plant fertiliser at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - **Liquid** fertiliser during flowering, following the product’s recommended rate and frequency.

### Pruning & Pinching

- **Pinch** the growing tips to encourage **denser growth**, stronger stems, and more flowers.  
  - Use sharp secateurs or snips to remove the top set of leaves, cutting just above a lower leaf set.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading or dead flowers just above a leaf set to promote more blooms.  
- After flowering ends, **prune back** to tidy the plant and stimulate new growth.  
  - Cut individual stems just above a lower leaf set.

### Flowering & Cutting

- Carnations typically **flower in 180–200 days**.  
- For cut‑flower production:  
  - Use sharp snips or secateurs to cut the longest stems, remove lower leaves, and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.

## Common Problems When Growing Carnations

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Irregular brown spots that start wet then dry into scab‑like patches; can cause premature leaf and flower drop. | Water at soil level (not on leaves), discard fallen leaves/fruits, practice crop rotation. |
| **Grey Mould (Botrytis)** | Mouldy flowers and rotting fruit; spores spread by wind, survive in soil or green waste. | Prune affected flowers/fruit, water at soil level, apply fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium Wilt** | Soil‑borne fungi that block water/nutrient flow; leaves wilt, dry, yellow, and may die. | No cure – use resistant varieties, discard affected plants/soil, maintain good hygiene, rotate crops. |
| **Rust (Puccinia)** | Brown to orange raised spots or patches on foliage; spores spread by wind/water, especially at 10–20 °C and high humidity. | Space plants to avoid overcrowding, provide full sun, avoid over‑fertilising, remove dead plants, rotate crops. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that nibble tender leaves at night, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use traps, or torchlight collection. |
| **Thrips** | Tiny black/beige/white flying insects (<1.5 mm); larvae leave small white or transparent marks on leaves and petals. | Hose off affected plants, encourage predatory mites/lacewings with companion planting, spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |

*All management tips are practical and can be applied by home gardeners to keep your carnations healthy and blooming beautifully.*
