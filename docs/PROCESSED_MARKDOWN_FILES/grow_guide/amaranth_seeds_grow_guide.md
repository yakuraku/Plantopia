**Family:** Amaranthaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Amaranthus sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Annual

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Amaranth loves *full sun* – pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs *well‑drained* loam rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, then dig or till to loosen the soil.  
  - Work in **aged animal manure or compost** to boost fertility.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Container Growing:**  
  - Choose a variety labeled for containers.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Containers should be **≥20 L** to give roots room to grow.  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the season.

## How to Sow Amaranth Seeds  

- **No pre‑treatment needed** – just sow!  
- **Direct sowing** is best.  
  1. **Plant 3 mm deep** and **60 cm apart**.  
  2. Keep the soil **moist but never soggy**.  
  3. Germination takes **7–10 days** at **20–25 °C**.  
  4. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  
- **Frost caution:** Amaranth is frost‑sensitive. **Never transplant or sow** until all frost danger has passed.

## Growing Amaranth  

### Watering  
- Water when the soil is **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (check by finger).  
- Aim for **deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering.  
- **Avoid wetting the leaves** to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilizing  
- If the soil is already well‑prepared, extra fertilizer is usually unnecessary.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release fertilizer** (high‑potassium or flowering‑plant formula) at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - **Liquid fertilizer** at the recommended rate/frequency during fruiting or flowering.

### Pinching  
- To encourage denser growth and stronger stems, **pinch off the top set of leaves** just above a lower leaf set using sharp secateurs or snips.

### Flowering  
- Amaranth typically **flowers in ~100 days**.

## Harvesting  

- **Leaves** are ready when they’re large enough to eat.  
  - Cut individual leaves from the plant.  
  - Or cut the entire plant at ground level for a quick harvest.  
  - Best enjoyed fresh; store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge for short‑term use.  

- **Cut Flowers**  
  - Use sharp snips or secateurs to cut the longest stems possible.  
  - Remove lower leaves and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.  
  - For more details on cutting and conditioning, see the *cutting and conditioning* guide.

- **Deadheading**  
  - Regularly trim faded or dead flowers just above a leaf set to encourage more blooms.

## Common Problems When Growing Amaranth  

| Problem | What to Watch For | Quick Fix |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Frost Damage** | Leaves wilt and turn black. | Don’t plant seedlings until all frost risk is gone; harvest before winter; prune damaged leaves. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level only, remove and destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding, consider a homemade milk spray or fungicide if needed. |
