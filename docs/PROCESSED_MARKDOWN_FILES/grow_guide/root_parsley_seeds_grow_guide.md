# How to Grow Root Parsley Seeds

**Family:** Apiaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Petroselinum tuberosum_  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Root parsley loves **full sun to part shade**. Aim for at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Loose, well‑drained, enriched with organic matter.  
  - Weigh out the area, **dig it over** to a spade’s depth, and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - In heavy soils, adding compost lightens the ground and lets roots breathe.  
- **Weed control:** Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.

## How to Sow Root Parsley Seeds

Root parsley seeds are *simple*—no soaking or stratification needed.  
**Direct sow** them for best results.

1. **Planting depth & spacing**  
   - Sow **5 mm deep**.  
   - Space seeds **30–40 cm apart** within rows, and keep rows **30 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture**  
   - Keep the soil **moist but never water‑logged**.  
3. **Germination**  
   - Expect **14–28 days** at a soil temperature of **10–30 °C**.  
4. **Protection**  
   - Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  

> **Tip:** Root parsley is a cool‑season crop. Avoid sowing or transplanting in hot weather to prevent premature bolting.

## How to Grow Root Parsley

- **Watering**  
  - Check the soil 5 cm below the surface; water when it feels dry.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - **Avoid wetting the leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.

- **Fertilizing**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, skip extra fertilizer.  
  - Over‑fertilizing can stunt root growth.  
  - In poor soil, use a **low‑nitrogen, high‑phosphorus** fertilizer (e.g., blood & bone) at the recommended rate.  
- **Thinning**  
  - When seedlings are sturdy enough, thin them to **30–40 cm spacing**. Pull out weak or small plants.  
- **Flower removal**  
  - To extend the plant’s life, pinch off flower stalks as soon as they appear.

## How to Harvest Root Parsley

- **Timing:** Ready to harvest in **100–130 days**.  
- **Leaves**  
  - Harvest when leaves are large enough to eat.  
  - Pinch off outer leaves, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
  - Consume fresh or store in a **perforated plastic bag** in the fridge.  
  - For longer storage, freeze whole or chopped leaves in ice‑cube trays.  
- **Roots**  
  - Harvest when roots are sizable.  
  - Gently pull at the base of the leaves or use a garden fork to lift multiple roots.  
  - Shake off soil, cut foliage **1–2 cm above** the root.  
  - Store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.

## Common Problems When Growing Root Parsley

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Why It Happens | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering & seed set | Extreme weather or heat | Sow after frost danger; keep plants well‑watered in hot weather |
| **Carrot fly** (_Psila rosa_) | Larvae burrow into roots | Eggs laid on seedlings | Companion planting or insect‑exclusion netting |
| **Forked roots** | Roots split into two | Stony or heavy clay soil | Lighten soil with coarse sand or compost; choose round/short varieties |
| **Small roots** | Roots underdeveloped | Over‑sowing or excess nitrogen | Thin seedlings; avoid fertilizing |
| **Split roots** | Roots crack or split | Inconsistent watering | Water deeply and evenly; consider rainfall before watering |
| **Tough roots** | Roots hard to chew | Harvested too late | Pick roots when young and tender |
| **Whitefly** | Yellowing or wilting leaves, white specks on underside | Sap‑sucking insects | Hose off or spray with soap solution; attract beneficial predators |

> **Pro tip:** If whitefly infestation is severe, consider destroying the affected plants to protect the rest of the bed.
