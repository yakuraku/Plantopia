  1. Weed thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  3. Add **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  4. Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Use a variety rated for container growing.  
  - Mix a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - **Minimum pot size:** 10 L (≈2.6 gal).  
  - Container plants may need **extra fertiliser** during the growing season.

## How to Sow Short‑Stemmed Catmint Seeds

Catmint seeds are **easy to handle**—no soaking or stratification required.

1. **Seed trays**  
   - Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sowing depth**  
   - Plant seeds **10 mm (½ inch) deep**.  
3. **Moisture**  
   - Keep soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
4. **Germination**  
   - Expect **10–20 days** at a soil temperature of **21–27 °C (70–80 °F)**.  
5. **Transplanting**  
   - Move seedlings when they have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing**  
   - Plant out at **60 cm (2 ft) apart**.  

> **Tip for cool climates:** Start indoors **6 weeks before the last frost**. Grow in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Short‑Stemmed Catmint

### Watering

- **Regular, even moisture** is key—don’t let the soil dry out.  
- Water **deeply** in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  

### Fertilising

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertiliser.  
- In poorer soils or for a boost:  
  - **High‑potassium or flowering‑plant fertiliser** works well.  
  - **Slow‑release**: apply at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
  - **Liquid**: apply during fruiting or flowering as recommended.  

### Flowering

- Catmint typically **blooms in ~105 days**.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading or dead flowers just above a leaf set with sharp secateurs or snips.  
- After flowering, **prune back** to tidy the plant and encourage vigorous new growth. Cut stems just above lower leaves.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Tender leaves and shoots eaten, especially at night; slimy trails. | • Remove hiding spots.<br>• Keep free‑range poultry.<br>• Collect by torchlight or use traps. |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insects on leaf undersides; yellowing or wilting leaves; stunted growth. | • Hose or soap spray.<br>• Destroy severely affected plants.<br>• Attract beneficial insects that prey on whitefly. |
