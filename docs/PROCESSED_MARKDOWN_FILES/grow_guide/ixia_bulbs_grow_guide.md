## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Ixia thrives in *full sun*. Pick a spot that receives **at least 6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs a **loose, well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Start by **weeding** thoroughly.  
  - Dig to **at least a spade’s depth** (≈30 cm) to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost** to lighten heavy soils and give roots room to grow.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

## How to Plant Ixia Bulbs

1. **Planting depth & spacing**  
   - Place bulbs **5–10 cm apart**.  
   - Dig a hole **5 cm deep** and set the bulb with the **pointed tip facing up**.  
2. **Cover & water**  
   - Fill the hole with soil, firm gently.  
   - Water well after planting.

## Growing Ixia

### Watering

- **Check soil moisture**: feel 5 cm below the surface; if dry, water.  
- **When to water**: early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid leaf wetness** to reduce fungal risk.  
- *Learn more about watering here.*

### Fertilising

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
- **Boosting nutrition** (optional):  
  - *High‑potassium* or *flower‑specific* fertilizer works well.  
  - **Slow‑release**: apply at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
  - **Liquid**: apply during flowering or fruiting, following the label’s rate and frequency.

### Flowering Time

- Expect blooms in **120–150 days** after planting.

### Cut‑Flower Tips

- Use **sharp snips or secateurs** to cut the longest stems.  
- Remove lower leaves and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.  
- *Learn more about cutting and conditioning homegrown flowers here.*

### Deadheading & Foliage Care

- **Regularly remove spent flowers** to redirect energy to the bulb.  
- Use sharp tools to cut or snap off dead blooms.  
- After flowering, let the foliage **die down naturally**; the bulb reabsorbs nutrients.  
- Once all leaves have browned, trim them to ground level with sharp secateurs or snips.

### Bulb Longevity & Mulching

- Ixia bulbs can stay in the ground for **several years** without lifting.  
- **Heavy mulch** protects bulbs from scorching summer heat.  
- In wet summers or when overcrowded, **lift and store** bulbs for the next season.

## Common Problems When Growing Ixia

| Problem | Symptoms | Management |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose to dislodge them.<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage natural predators (ladybugs, lacewings).<br>• *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Rotten bulbs or corms** | Bulbs show rot, lack roots/shoots, or produce stunted yellow leaves without flowers. | • Plant in **free‑draining soil**, raised beds, or containers.<br>• **Do not water** while dormant.<br>• Lift and store bulbs if your climate is wet during winter.<br>• *Read more about bulb rot here.* |
