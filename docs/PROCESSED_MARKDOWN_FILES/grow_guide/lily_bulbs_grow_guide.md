# How to Grow Lily Bulbs  

**Family:** Liliaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Lilium sp._  
**Life Cycle:** perennial  

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Lilies thrive in *full sun* or *partial shade*. Aim for at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Afternoon sun:** If strong afternoon light is unavoidable, **water more frequently** to keep the soil from drying out and prevent wilting.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be *well‑drained* and rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, loosen the ground, and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

### Growing Lilies in Containers  

- Choose a variety **recommended for container growing**.  
- Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot that holds at least **20 L** (5 gal).  
- Container plants often need **extra fertiliser** during the growing season to stay healthy.  

## How to Plant Lily Bulbs  

1. **Keep bulbs moist** until planting; buy fresh (not dormant) bulbs and plant ASAP.  
2. **Plant in clusters** so stems can support each other.  
3. **Spacing & depth**  
   - In the garden: **20–40 cm** apart.  
   - In containers: **7–10 cm** apart.  
   - Depth: **10–15 cm** with roots at the bottom.  
4. **Cover with soil** and water well.  
5. **Maintain moisture** (but not waterlogged) until shoots appear.  

## How to Grow Lilies  

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface; water when dry.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering* [here](#).  

- **Mulching:**  
  - Apply a **thick layer of organic mulch** (lucerne or pea straw) before summer to keep roots cool and retain moisture.  

- **Fertilising:**  
  - When buds form, apply a **balanced liquid or slow‑release fertiliser** at the recommended rate to keep lower leaves green.  

- **Harvest time:**  
  - Lilies are ready in **70–120 days**.  

### Cutting Cut Flowers  

1. Cut when the first buds *just begin to open*.  
2. Trim about **halfway down** the stem.  
3. Strip lower leaves, soak the stem in clean water for a few hours, then cut again at a **45° angle**.  
4. Transfer to a vase.  

*Optional:* Gently remove or pull off the anthers to prevent pollen staining tables or fabrics.  

### Post‑Bloom Care  

- After flowering, **cut back** the stems, leaving **half the stem** to feed the bulb for next year.  
- When foliage dies, top‑dress with compost or a balanced slow‑release fertiliser.  
- Cut stems at ground level.  
- Bulbs can stay in the ground for future seasons.  
- If the clump becomes overcrowded, **lift, divide, and replant** in late autumn or early winter.  

## Common Problems When Growing Lilies  

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow to grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level, remove and destroy affected leaves, ensure good airflow. If persistent, use a homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Rotten Bulbs/Corms** | Bulbs show rot, lack roots or shoots, or produce stunted yellow leaves. | Plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers; avoid watering while dormant; lift and store if climate requires. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves and shoots, leaving slimy trails, mainly at night. | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, collect by torchlight, or use traps. |
