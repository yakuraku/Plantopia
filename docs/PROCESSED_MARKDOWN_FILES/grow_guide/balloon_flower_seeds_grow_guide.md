## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot** – Balloon flowers are perennials, so pick a location that won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Sunlight** – They thrive in **full sun or part shade**. Aim for at least **3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil** – Needs a **well‑drained, organic‑rich** mix.  
  - Weed thoroughly.  
  - Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  - Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Container growing** – If you’re using pots:  
  - Pick a variety suited for containers.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Choose a pot **≥ 10 L** for mature plants.  
  - Remember that container plants may need extra fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Balloon Flower Seeds

Balloon flower seeds are **easy to handle** – no soaking or stratification needed. Light exposure can boost germination, so press seeds onto damp soil and lightly cover with fine soil.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **0 mm deep** and **30 cm apart** in the garden. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but not waterlogged**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **14–28 days** at **16–18 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **0 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist but not soggy** soil. |
| 4 | Germination: **14–28 days** at **16–18 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **30 cm apart** when planting out. |

> **Tip:** Some varieties can be slow to germinate. Patience and strict adherence to depth and temperature guidelines give the best results.

## How to Grow Balloon Flower

- **Watering**  
  - Keep soil **evenly moist** but never waterlogged.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  

- **Fertilizing**  
  - If soil is already well‑prepared, **extra fertilizer isn’t usually needed**.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertilizer** (high‑potassium or flowering‑plant formula) at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid fertilizer** during flowering or fruiting, following the product’s recommended rate and frequency.  

- **Flowering**  
  - Balloon flowers typically bloom after **≈ 200 days**.  
  - **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading or dead flowers just above a set of leaves with sharp secateurs or snips. This encourages more blooms.  
  - After flowering, **prune back** to tidy the plant and stimulate strong new growth. Cut stems just above lower leaves.  
  - In late autumn, cut plants back **just above ground level** if they die back in cold weather. In spring, prune off any dead foliage as new leaves emerge.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides | Water at soil level, remove affected leaves, ensure good airflow. If persistent, use a homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Root rot** | Slow establishment, yellowing/wilted foliage, soft brown tissue at stem base | Remove and discard affected plants. Reduce soil moisture, add organic matter, keep mulch away from stems. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Tender leaf damage, slimy trails, mainly at night | Remove hiding spots, use free‑range poultry, spot‑light to collect, or set traps. |
