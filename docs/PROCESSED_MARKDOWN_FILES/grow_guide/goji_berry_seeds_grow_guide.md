---

## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot** – Goji berries are long‑lived. Pick a location where the plants can stay undisturbed for years.  
- **Sunlight** – Full sun or part shade works best. Aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Space for spreading** – These plants often send out suckers from the roots. If you want them to stay contained, either **break suckers below soil level** or grow the plant in a container.  
- **Container growing** – Use a variety suited for pots.  
  - **Pot size:** Minimum **40 L** for mature plants.  
  - **Soil:** High‑quality potting mix.  
  - **Fertiliser:** Container plants may need extra feeding during the growing season.

## How to Sow Goji Berry Seeds

Goji seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking or stratification required.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | **Plant seeds 8 mm deep** in the garden, spacing **200 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but never waterlogged**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **14–28 days** at **20–25 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **good seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **8 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist but not soggy** soil. |
| 4 | Germinate in **14–28 days** at **20–25 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **200 cm apart** in the garden. |

> **Tip:** Goji seeds can be slow to sprout. Be patient, stick to the depth and temperature guidelines, and you’ll improve your chances of success.

### Frost‑Sensitive Seedlings

- In cooler climates, start seeds indoors **6 weeks before the last expected frost**.  
- Keep them in a **warm spot with plenty of natural light**.

## How to Grow Goji Berry Plants

### Watering

- **Check moisture**: Feel 5 cm below the surface; if dry, water.  
- **When to water**: Early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid leaf wetness** to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Nutrient‑poor soils** are fine—no extra fertiliser needed during the growing season.

### Winter Care

- Goji berries may die back in cold weather.  
- **Prune** back to just above ground level in late autumn, or remove dead foliage as new leaves appear in spring.

## How to Harvest Goji Berries

- **Harvest window:** **90–110 days** after sowing.  
- **Peak production:** When plants are **3–5 years old**.  
- **Ready fruit:** Fully coloured pods.  
- **Method:** Cut pods with snips or secateurs.  
- **Frequency:** Harvest regularly to encourage more pods.  
- **Uses:** Fresh, juiced, frozen, or dried.  
  - *Drying tip:* Spread berries in a single layer on a rack in the sun or use a dehydrator.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----|
| **Blossom End Rot** | Fruit darkens from the bottom up; hard, darker area. | *Dispose* of affected fruit. Water **regularly and evenly**. Check soil pH and calcium levels. |
| **Animals (possums, birds, etc.)** | Sudden loss of harvest. | Use **netting or cages**. Try a homemade spray of garlic, fish oil, or mustard. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves. | Water at **soil level** (not on leaves). Ensure good airflow. Remove affected leaves. Use a fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Spider Mites** | Dry, wilted, or discoloured leaves; fine sandpaper feel on undersides. | Prune for airflow. Spray with **eco‑oil** or **wettable sulphur**. |

> *Remember:* Early detection and consistent care are the keys to a healthy, productive goji berry garden.
