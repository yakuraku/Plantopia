**Life Cycle:** Perennial

## Preparation

- **Legal note:** European blackberry (*Rubus fruticosus* and related species) is a declared weed in Australia.  
  Thornless blackberries are complex hybrids from several *Rubus* species and are *not* listed as weeds in Australia.

- **Choose a permanent spot** – blackberries are perennials and thrive when left undisturbed.  
- **Sunlight:** Aim for **at least 3 h of full sun** per day; partial shade is acceptable but less productive.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen, and enrich with aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Tip:* Read more about soil prep for planting [here](#).

## How to Plant Blackberry Canes

Plant soon after delivery to keep roots moist.

1. **Remove** the cane from the bag and shake off the coir.  
2. **Soak** the roots in water for **1–2 h** (don’t exceed 2 h to avoid rot).  
   - Optional: add seaweed solution at the recommended rate.  
3. **Spacing:** 150–180 cm apart.  
4. **Dig** a 30 cm deep hole and create a small mound in the center.  
5. **Place** the roots on the mound, spread them evenly.  
6. **Cover** with soil, ensuring the stem’s base is level with the surface.  
7. **Water** well after planting.  

*Optional:* Prune the cane to ~20 cm above the ground after planting to encourage root growth and new shoots.

## How to Grow Blackberry Canes

- **Support:** Install a trellis or sturdy support *before* planting.  
  - Tie gently with twine or plant ties.  
  - Train canes in a wave pattern along the trellis for easier management.  
- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water deeply in early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
  - Learn more about watering [here](#).  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If soil is already well‑prepared, skip extra fertilizer.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - *Slow‑release* fertilizer at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - *Liquid* fertilizer during fruiting or flowering, following the recommended rate and frequency.

## How to Prune Blackberry Canes

Blackberries fruit on **two‑year‑old canes (floricanes)**. Two common pruning methods:

### Method 1 – Tie‑and‑Prune
1. While fruiting, **mark** fruiting canes with a soft tie (e.g., wool).  
2. In winter, **prune** those canes to the ground.  
3. Leave unfruiting new canes unpruned—they’ll fruit next year.

### Method 2 – Bundle‑and‑Train
1. Bundle the year‑old canes and train them to higher trellis wires.  
2. As new canes emerge, tie them to lower wires.  
3. In winter, prune the old canes to the ground.  
4. Bundle the new canes and train them to higher wires for the next season.

**Seasonal pruning** can encourage branching, remove weak or diseased canes, and improve airflow.

**Suckers** (new shoots a few feet from the parent) can be dug up for propagation or cut below soil level to control spread.

## How to Harvest Blackberry

- **Ready to pick** when fruit is firm and fully colored.  
- **Harvest** by gently pulling the berries off the plant.  
- **Enjoy soon** after picking for best flavor.  
- **Short‑term storage:** Keep in a container in the fridge.  
- **Long‑term options:** Freeze, can, or make jam/sauce.

## Common Problems When Growing Blackberry

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Grey mould** (*Botrytis* sp.) | Mouldy flowers, rotting fruit; thrives in cool, damp weather | Prune affected parts, water at soil level, use fungicide or homemade spray |
| **Queensland Fruit Fly** (*Bactrocera tryoni*) | Eggs in fruit, premature drop, larvae inside | Dispose of fallen fruit, use insect netting, install traps |
| **Animals (possums, birds, etc.)** | Sudden loss of harvest | Netting or cages; homemade sprays (garlic, fish oil, mustard) |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium wilt** | Wilting, yellowing leaves, dry branches | No cure; choose resistant varieties, remove affected plants, practice crop rotation |
| **Thrips** | Tiny insects, white/transparent leaf marks | Hose off, attract predatory mites/lacewings, use soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil |
| **Spider mites** (Tetranychus urticae) | Dry, wilted, discolored leaves; sandpaper feel underside | Prune for airflow, spray eco‑oil or wettable sulphur |
