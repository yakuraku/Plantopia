# How to Make Your Own Seed Raising Mix  

---  

**16 December 2021**  

Seeds that start under the kindest conditions have the best chance of germinating reliably, developing strong root systems, and growing into healthy plants. While ordinary garden soil and potting mix are common choices, a dedicated seed‑raising mix can give your seedlings the *ideal* environment to thrive.  

Commercial mixes are available, but making your own is quick, cost‑effective, and offers several key benefits. Here’s everything you need to know.  

## What Exactly Is Seed Raising Mix?  

Seed‑raising mix is a **fine‑textured blend of soil and other materials** that gently cradles seeds as they germinate and grow into seedlings.  

- **Fine texture**:  
  - Seeds are fully surrounded, encouraging germination.  
  - Small gaps allow **air circulation** and **excess moisture** to drain.  
  - Tender shoots can push through easily, conserving energy for healthy growth and stronger roots.  

- **Why ordinary garden soil falls short**:  
  - Heavy, coarse particles block shoots.  
  - Prone to drying out and forming a crust, causing water to pool on the surface.  
  - Often contains weed seeds, pests, and diseases that stress seedlings.  

- **Why potting mix can be problematic**:  
  - Larger particles (e.g., pine bark chunks) make sowing small seeds difficult.  
  - Can prevent roots and shoots from developing straight and true.  

- **Nutrient profile**:  
  - Seed‑raising mix usually contains only a **small amount of nutrients**.  
  - Seeds have enough energy for the first stage, but once true leaves appear, you’ll need to feed them with fertilizer or transplant into a richer medium.  

## Reasons to Make Your Own Seed Raising Mix  

While commercial mixes are convenient, rolling your own offers distinct advantages:  

- **Tailored to each seed**: Adjust density, drainage, and texture by tweaking the recipe.  
- **Organic gardening**: Create a mix that meets your organic standards—certified organic mixes are rare and pricey.  
- **No unwanted additives**: Avoid fungicides or other treatments you might not want in your garden.  

Experienced gardeners report easier germination and healthier plants when using a homemade mix. It’s simple to make and definitely worth trying.  

## Two Ways to Make Seed Raising Mix  

You can start with a standard potting mix or craft a custom blend from scratch.  

### Safety First  

Fine‑textured materials can become airborne.  
- Wear a face mask.  
- Work in a well‑ventilated area.  
- Wash your hands afterward.  

### Basic Tools  

- Small container (e.g., a yoghurt or ice‑cream pot) for measuring.  
- Larger bucket or tub for mixing.  
- Sieve, colander, or “riddle” soil strainer with holes **0.5–1 cm** wide.  
  - If none, a sheet of wire mesh works as an improvised option.  

### Method 1: Using Standard Potting Mix  

1. **Sieve** the potting mix to remove large particles.  
   - Keep only the composted bark fines and sand grains.  
   - Reuse the larger particles as mulch or add them to your compost heap.  
2. **Add nutrients**:  
   - Mix in ground worm castings or finely sifted homemade compost.  
   - Aim for **¼–⅓** of the total volume.  
3. **Result**: Your seed‑raising mix is ready to use.  

### Method 2: Using a Recipe  

A custom recipe lets you fine‑tune the mix for each seed type.  
**Proportions (rough guide)**  

| Ingredient | Ratio | Purpose |
|------------|-------|---------|
| **Vermiculite or sand** | 1 part | Improves drainage (use builder’s or coarse sand). |
| **Coir** | 2 parts | Enhances water retention. |
| **Worm castings or aged cow manure** | ½ part | Provides a base level of nutrients. |
| **Fine‑textured compost** | 2 parts | Forms the growing medium. |

**Steps**  

1. Combine all ingredients.  
2. Mix until the blend is as fine as possible—no large clumps.  
3. Use immediately or store in a covered container to prevent hardening and weed seed contamination.  

Your homemade seed‑raising mix is now ready. Expect quicker, more reliable germination and healthier growth, leading to productive mature plants.
