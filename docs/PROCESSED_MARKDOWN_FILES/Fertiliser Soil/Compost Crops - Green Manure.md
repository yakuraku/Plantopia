# Compost Crops – Green Manure

## What It Is  
**Green compost**, also called **green manure**, is a simple yet powerful way to enrich your soil.  
- Plant a nitrogen‑rich crop, let it grow until just before it flowers, then gently till it into the soil.  
- Leave the residue in the ground for about six weeks before planting your next crop.  

## Who Uses Green Composting?  
This age‑old technique has been a staple for:  

| Culture | Practice | Modern Use |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Ancient Greeks | Ploughed broad beans back into the soil | Organic & biodynamic growers |
| Chinese | Grew grasses and weeds | Sustainable home gardeners |
| Early Americans | “Fallow” cycle | Large‑scale organic farms |

Today, **organic, sustainable, and biodynamic** gardeners often dedicate a good portion of their beds to cover crops. It’s a natural, cost‑effective way to avoid synthetic fertilizers and keep soil free of toxins.

## When & Why to Plant a Green Compost Crop  

1. **Soil looks old or tired** – no dark brown, crumbly texture.  
2. **Recent bumper crop** – the soil may have been depleted.  
3. **Garden performance has dipped** – time to restore vigor.  
4. **Seasonal lull** – no other crops fit the calendar.  
5. **Prevent topsoil loss** – cover the area until you’re ready to plant again.  
6. **Weed suppression** – a living mulch keeps weeds at bay.  
7. **Boost soil life** – feeds earthworms, bacteria, and beneficial insects.  
8. **Natural pest control** – frogs and beetles thrive on cover crops and eat pests.  

If any of these points resonate, it’s a perfect moment to start a green compost plot.

## The Science Behind Green Composting  

- **Nitrogen Fixation** – legumes host nitrogen‑fixing bacteria in root nodules, returning nitrogen to the soil in a *symbiotic* way.  
- **Other Nutrients** – many cover crops add potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, and sulfur.  
- **Deep Roots** – plants like alfalfa can send roots 18 m deep, aerating the soil, bringing up nutrients, and creating channels for water.  
- **Water Retention** – deep root systems reduce runoff and improve moisture availability for subsequent crops.  

The result? A healthier, more resilient soil ecosystem that supports stronger, disease‑resistant plants.

> *Example:* A garden bed of mustard, almost ready to be tilled, shows how quickly a cover crop can be incorporated.

## Best Composting Crops  

| Crop | Why It’s Great | Extra Benefits |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **Amaranth, Quinoa, Millet** | Highly nutritious, good as cover crops | Limited specific data, but excellent food sources |
| **Buckwheat** | Dense foliage, excellent weed control | Quick growth, attracts pollinators |
| **Fenugreek** | Germinates in cold soils, adds nitrogen, loosens heavy clay | Weed suppression |
| **Legumes** (clover, lucerne/alfalfa, peas, beans) | Large foliage, nitrogen, attracts beneficial insects | Lucerne/alfalfa offers the deepest roots |
| **Lupin** | Accumulates nitrogen & phosphorus | Flowers attract bees and other beneficial insects |
| **Mustard** | Large foliage, attracts beneficial insects | Suppresses fungal disease, controls nematodes; great after potatoes to kill wireworms |
| **Oats** | Controls nematodes, adds organic matter | Easy to grow, quick cover |
| **Sorghum** | Thrives in dry areas, dense foliage | Holds dirt, good for erosion control |
