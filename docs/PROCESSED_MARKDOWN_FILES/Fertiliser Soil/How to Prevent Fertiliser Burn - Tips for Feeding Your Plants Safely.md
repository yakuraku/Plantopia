# How to Prevent Fertiliser Burn: Tips for Feeding Your Plants Safely

===================================================================
3 December 2024

While healthy soil is often all you need to grow abundant produce, a timely dose of fertiliser can give your plants that extra push. But, as with many good things, **too much can backfire**—leading to the dreaded *fertiliser burn*.

## Understanding Fertiliser Burn

In plain language, fertiliser burn happens when **excess nutrients** (or salts) overwhelm a plant’s roots, especially when the plant is already stressed. It’s most common with fast‑acting, soluble fertilisers—whether liquid or granular—applied in hot weather.

- **Why salts matter**: Every fertiliser, even organic ones like fresh manure, contains salts that help dissolve nutrients. Synthetic fertilisers often have *higher concentrations*, so a little can go a long way.
- **The imbalance**: When you apply fertiliser, the soil becomes saltier than the water inside the plant’s roots. The plant then pulls water *from* its own tissues to balance the salt levels, reversing the normal flow of fluids.
- **What it looks like**: Yellow or brown leaf tips and margins, wilting, and white or light‑brown patches that feel dry and crispy.

## What Causes Fertiliser Burn?

- **Over‑application**: The amounts listed on fertiliser packets are *tested* to keep plants safe. Adding more only raises the risk of harm.
- **Stressed plants**: Dehydrated or heat‑stressed plants are especially vulnerable. Think of how you feel after a salty snack without water!
- **High temperatures**: Hot weather increases water demand and the chance of burn.

## Tips for Avoiding Fertiliser Burn

1. **Read the packet carefully**  
   - Follow the recommended mix, application method, and frequency.  
   - Garden vs. potted plants often have different guidelines.  
   - *Tip*: Start with a smaller dose and build up gradually.

2. **Choose organic or slow‑release options**  
   - These release nutrients slowly, reducing the risk of a sudden salt spike.  
   - They may take longer to show results, but they’re gentler on your plants.

3. **Water before and after fertilising**  
   - Water the day before to hydrate the roots.  
   - Keep watering for a few days after to help nutrients move where they’re needed.

4. **Mind the temperature**  
   - Avoid fertilising when the forecast max is **30 °C (86 °F)** or higher.  
   - In hot climates, fertilise in the late afternoon and keep up watering.  
   - Prefer slow‑release or compost in the hottest months.  
   - Feed perennials in **autumn and spring** instead of midsummer.

5. **Target the soil, not the leaves**  
   - Unless you’re doing a foliar feed, water the soil around the roots.  
   - Spraying fertiliser directly on leaves can leave a salty residue that burns the foliage.

## Treating Fertiliser Burn

If you spot burn signs, don’t panic—most cases are fixable:

1. **Flush the soil**  
   - Water deeply every day for at least a week.  
   - For pots, water until it runs out of the drainage holes, then let excess drain away.  
   - This leaches out excess salts and rehydrates the roots.

2. **Prune damaged leaves**  
   - Cut off any leaves that look badly affected.  
   - They won’t recover and can become breeding grounds for mould or rot.

*Fertiliser burn might seem daunting, but with the right knowledge and a patient approach, it’s easily avoided. Your plants will thank you for it!*
