# Homemade Liquid Fertiliser  
*8 April 2016*  

Sometimes called **“compost tea,” “liquid manure,”** or **“manure tea,”** homemade liquid fertiliser is a *simple* and *effective* way to give your garden a nutrient boost during the growing season.  
All you need is a little time and a few household items: soak manure and/or weeds in water for a couple of weeks, and the liquid that forms is a ready‑to‑use, root‑friendly fertilizer.

## What You’ll Need

- **Container** – a bucket, old garbage bin, or drum  
- **Animal manure** and/or **weeds**  
- **Mesh bag & string** – a hessian sack, old stocking, or tea towel works great  
- **Water** – rainwater is ideal (chlorine can slow the microbes), but if you only have tap water, let it sit uncovered for a few days before brewing to allow chlorine to evaporate

## Brewing Your Liquid Fertiliser

1. **Pack the bag** with a generous amount of manure and/or weeds. Tie it securely with string to create a “tea bag.”  
2. **Suspend** the bag in your container (you can use a pole or stick for support).  
3. **Fill** the container almost to the top with water.  
4. **Stir** the mixture a few times a day to keep the microbes active.  
5. **Wait** – after **2–3 weeks** the brew is ready. The liquid will turn a dark brown and the strong, foul smell will fade.

## Using Your Brew

- **Dilute** to the strength of a weak tea (≈ 1 part fertiliser : 10 parts water).  
- **Apply** to the soil around plants, or very lightly to seedlings.  
- **Frequency** – every week or every ten days works well.  
- **Tip** – if the soil feels dry, water it first; the liquid will then be absorbed more efficiently.  
- **Benefit** – healthy, well‑fed plants are more resistant to pests and diseases.

> **Safety note:**  
> Liquid manure contains beneficial bacteria, so avoid spraying it on edible parts of plants or just before harvest. Wash all produce thoroughly before eating, and always wash your hands after handling the brew.

## Common Questions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **What weeds and manure can I use?** | Cow, chicken, or sheep manure are best. Any weeds will work—this is a great way to recycle nutrients from invasive species (e.g., couch grass) without sending them to the green‑waste bin. |
| **What do I do with the tea‑bag contents after brewing?** | Simply add the leftover solids to your compost heap. |
| **How do I know when the brew is ready?** | After 2–3 weeks, the liquid should be dark brown and the strong odor should have faded. |
