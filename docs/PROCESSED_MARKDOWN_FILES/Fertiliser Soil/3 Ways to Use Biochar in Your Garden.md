## What Is Biochar?  

Biochar is a *charcoal* produced by heating organic material in a low‑oxygen environment—a process called **pyrolysis**.  
- **Sources:** FSC‑certified wood, agricultural waste (e.g., walnut shells).  
- **Result:** A lightweight, black charcoal packed with fine capillaries and air pockets.  

### Why It Matters in Soil  
- Acts like a sponge, **holding water and nutrients**.  
- Provides a habitat for **microorganisms** and **mycorrhizal fungi**.  
- Decomposes very slowly, locking carbon in the soil for the long term.

## Types of Biochar  

| Type | Common Names | Typical Use |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Straight (Naked)** | “Naked” biochar | Soil conditioner; not a fertilizer replacement |
| **Enriched (Activated/Charged/Inoculated)** | Activated, charged, inoculated | Contains added nutrients or microbes to prevent nitrogen drawdown |

> **Tip:** When using naked biochar, mix it with compost or aged manure to offset potential nitrogen loss.

## Pros & Cons  

### Benefits  
- **Improves water & nutrient retention**  
- **Supports beneficial microbes & mycorrhizal fungi**  
- **Enhances soil structure** (especially in heavy soils)  
- **Can raise pH** if slightly alkaline  
- **Sequesters carbon**—reduces CO₂, CH₄, N₂O emissions  
- **Long‑lasting**—no need for annual applications  

### Drawbacks  
- Slight alkalinity may **raise pH too much** for acid‑loving plants (blueberries, rhododendrons).  
- **Carbon sequestration** on a home‑garden scale is modest.  
- Ongoing research on optimal inputs, particle size, and sustainability standards.

## 3 Practical Ways to Use Biochar  

> **Application Basics:** Sprinkle over soil, then lightly dig or water in.  
> **Safety:**  
> - Wear a mask—fine dust can irritate.  
> - Avoid windy days.  
> - Commercial biochar is safer than BBQ charcoal or wood ash, which may contain chemicals or microplastics.  
> - Don’t use nutrient‑enriched biochar in waterlogged soils or before heavy rain to prevent leaching.  

### 1. Seed‑Sowing Mix  
- **Ratio:** 1 L biochar : 5–10 L compost.  
- **DIY:** Replace perlite, vermiculite, or coir with biochar in your seed‑raising mix.  

### 2. Potting Mix  
- **Ratio:** 1 L biochar : 10 L container potting mix.  
- Works well for **multi‑purpose or container** mixes.  

### 3. Garden Beds  
- **Coverage:** 1 L biochar ≈ 1 m² of bed.  
- **Depth:** Mix into the top 15–30 cm of soil.  
- **Frequency:** Apply every 6–12 weeks during the growing season until the top 15–30 cm contains **5–10 % by volume** biochar.  
- **Targeted Application:** If you have limited biochar, sprinkle it at the bottom of rows or into planting holes for maximum root benefit.
