# What’s in a Handful of Soil?  
**Understanding the Soil Food Web**

## What Does “Healthy Soil” Really Mean?  
When you ask a gardener about healthy soil, the answer is always a resounding **yes**. But what does that actually look like?  
- *Healthy soil* is a living, breathing ecosystem that fuels the best‑grown veggies, herbs, and flowers.  
- Learning what’s inside the soil is the first step toward building that ecosystem in your own garden.

## The Soil Food Web 101  
Soil isn’t just sand and minerals; it’s a **rich tapestry of organic matter**—roots, fallen leaves, and decomposing plant material—plus a bustling community of living creatures.  
- **Inorganic**: sand, clay, minerals  
- **Organic**: roots, leaf litter, plant debris  
- **Living community**: the *soil food web*  

From the largest to the smallest, the food web includes:  
1. **Mammals** (e.g., burrowing rodents)  
2. **Worms**  
3. **Slugs & snails**  
4. **Spiders & insects**  
5. **Nematodes**  
6. **Protozoa**  
7. **Fungi**  
8. **Bacteria**  
9. **Plant roots** (integral part of the web)

## What Lives in a Handful of Soil?  
A single **200 g** of crop‑ready soil can host an astonishing array of life:

| Organism | Number per 200 g |
|----------|------------------|
| Insects, spiders, worms, molluscs | ~5 000 |
| Protozoa | ~100 000 |
| Nematodes | ~10 000 |
| Bacteria | **100 000 000 000** (100 billion) |
| Fungal filaments | 50 km of hyphae |
| Plant roots | up to 0.5 km of root hairs |

*Why does this matter?*  
- These organisms **feed each other**, forming a complex food chain.  
- They **cycle carbon and nitrogen**, turning organic matter into nutrients plants can use.  
- Greater biodiversity usually equals **healthier soil** and **stronger plants**.

## The Tiny Titans: Microorganisms  
Even though we can’t see them, bacteria and fungi are the backbone of soil health.

### Bacteria  
- Decompose plant litter into usable forms.  
- Some break down pesticides and pollutants.  
- Improve soil texture and water‑holding capacity.

### Fungi  
- Break down organic matter, releasing nutrients.  
- Hyphae bind soil particles, enhancing water infiltration.  

### Protozoa & Nematodes  
- Feed on bacteria.  
- Become prey for arthropods (slaters, beetles, ants, millipedes).  
- Their activity helps aerate and mix the soil.

### Earthworms  
- Consume organic matter.  
- Their burrows improve structure, water flow, and root growth.

## Soil as Habitat  
- **Top 2–3 cm**: richest in organic matter; most life lives here.  
- **Worms**: burrow deeper.  
- **Fungi**: hyphae can extend meters down.  
- **Bacteria**: can be washed even deeper by rainfall.  

### The Rhizosphere  
- The thin **1 mm** zone around each root.  
- Packed with life because roots exude water, sugars, and organic compounds.  
- Microbes in this zone supply plants with nutrients, vitamins, and growth‑promoting substances.

### Air Pockets  
- Up to **25 %** of healthy topsoil is air.  
- Essential for oxygen‑dependent organisms.  
- Preventing compaction and waterlogging keeps these pockets intact—hence the “fluffy” or “light” soil description.

## Practical Take‑Aways for Gardeners  

| Action | Why It Helps |
|--------|--------------|
| **Avoid broad‑spectrum pesticides** | Preserves beneficial microbes and insects. |
| **Prevent compaction** | Keeps air pockets and root access. |
| **Avoid waterlogging** | Prevents oxygen loss and harmful anaerobic conditions. |
| **Limit unnecessary tilling** | Maintains the natural structure and food web. |
| **Add compost & organic matter** | Feeds the tiniest soil dwellers, boosting the entire ecosystem. |

By keeping the soil food web in mind, you’ll nurture a vibrant, self‑sustaining garden that thrives on its own natural resources.
