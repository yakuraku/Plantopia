# How to Create New, Weed‑Free Beds with Sheet Mulching

**Date:** 21 January 2022  

Great soil is the foundation of successful growing, and when you’re starting a new garden bed it’s essential to build a *fertile, weed‑free* area from the very beginning.  
Instead of hours of digging and weeding, sheet mulching offers an all‑natural shortcut—just be ready to wait a few months for the magic to happen.

## What Is Sheet Mulching?

Sheet mulching layers cardboard or newspaper with organic material to:

- **Smother weeds** without any chemicals  
- **Enrich the soil** as the existing vegetation breaks down  
- **Save labour** by eliminating manual weeding and digging  

The trade‑off? A bit of patience—natural decomposition can take *six months or more* before the bed is ready for planting.

## What You’ll Need

| Item | Tips |
|------|------|
| **Cardboard or newspaper** | Use ordinary, uncoated sheets. Avoid waxed or plastic‑coated paper. Remove any tape, glue, staples, or other non‑compostable items. |
| **Fine‑textured organic material** | Shredded leaves, compost, wood chips, prunings, cut grass, soft clippings, spent annuals. Aim for a balanced mix of nitrogen‑rich (grass, clippings) and carbon‑rich (leaves, wood chips) materials to keep the mix open and light. |
| **Natural fertilizer** | Rotted animal manure, manure pellets, or blood & bone. Adjust the amount if you’re planting natives—less is better to mimic their preferred poor soils. |
| **Optional soil amendments** | Gypsum for heavy clay, other site‑specific amendments. |

## How to Lay Sheet Mulching (10 Simple Steps)

> *You can start anytime, but beginning in autumn gives you beds ready for spring planting.*

1. **Mark the bed**  
   - Dig a small trench or install a garden edge to outline the new bed.

2. **Cut the existing lawn or weeds**  
   - Use a mower or whipper snipper to trim as low as possible, leaving clippings on the surface.

3. **Apply aged manure & amendments**  
   - Sprinkle a light layer of aged manure and any other soil amendments (e.g., gypsum for clay). Water in well.

4. **Lay the first sheet**  
   - Place 4–6 sheets of cardboard/newspaper per layer.  
   - Overlap joints by **15–20 cm** and ensure the sheet extends to the edges with no gaps.

5. **Protect existing plants**  
   - If you’re keeping trees or shrubs, leave a small gap around their trunks to avoid collar rot.

6. **Water the sheet**  
   - Saturate the cardboard/newspaper until it’s completely soaked.

7. **Add the natural fertilizer**  
   - Spread the same amount you would for normal fertilizing.  
   - For native beds, use less to simulate poorer soils.

8. **Top with organic material**  
   - Spread 10–30 cm of your mixed organic layer.  
   - Either mix all materials together or layer them.  
   - Finish with a coarse top layer (straw, pine bark, etc.) for extra weed protection and visual appeal.

9. **Water again**  
   - Give the entire bed a good soak to kickstart decomposition.

10. **Monitor and maintain**  
    - Check for weeds, especially those creeping in from the sides.  
    - Water during dry spells.  
    - After several months, the cardboard and weeds should have fully decomposed into a usable bed.

## Planting in the New Bed

- **Wait for full decomposition** if you’re planting trees or long‑lived perennials.  
- **Short‑term use:**  
  - Punch small holes in the mulch, fill with potting mix, and plant annuals, herbs, or shallow‑rooted plants.  
  - Be vigilant—remove any weeds that emerge through the holes.  
- **Cover crops:**  
  - If you’ve used a fine‑textured layer, plant a cover crop immediately to suppress weeds and improve appearance.  
  - Great options: green manure, biofumigation mixes, or nasturtiums.

Whether you plant right away or wait for the mulch to fully rot, you’ll end up with a **rich, fertile bed** ready to support veggies, annuals, and more.
