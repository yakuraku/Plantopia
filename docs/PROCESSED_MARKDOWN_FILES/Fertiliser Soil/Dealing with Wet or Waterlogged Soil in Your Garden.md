## ❓ Climate Zones FAQ  

**What if I can’t find my climate zone?**  
> Look for a nearby area with a similar climate and use that zone as a guide.

**What if I live on the border of two zones?**  
> Read both descriptions and pick the one that fits your garden’s microclimate. You may be able to grow a wider range of plants than the zone alone suggests.

**What is a microclimate?**  
> A small area where temperature or humidity differs from the surrounding region. For example, a garden protected by buildings or large trees may be frost‑free even in a frosty zone.

**Can I grow varieties not listed for my climate zone?**  
> Yes! Start with recommended seeds for your zone, then experiment with neighbouring‑zone varieties once you’ve had some successes.
