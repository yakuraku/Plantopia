# Flowers, Pollinators, and Beneficial Insects – A Practical Guide

Understanding the *who* and *why* behind pollination can turn your garden into a thriving ecosystem. Below is a quick‑reference guide that keeps all the technical details while making it easy to apply in your own space.

## Honeybees (European & Native)

| Feature | What They Love | Practical Tips |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **Color** | Blue, purple, yellow (avoid red) | Plant **blue‑violet** or **yellow** blooms like *borage* or *marigold*. |
| **Light** | See ultraviolet (UV) | Use UV‑reflecting flowers such as *lavender* or *sunflower* to attract them. |
| **Scent** | Sweet, nectar‑rich | Add **sweet‑smelling** herbs (e.g., *rosemary*, *thyme*) near bee beds. |
| **Activity** | Warm, calm days | Provide **shade** during hot afternoons to keep bees comfortable. |
| **Flower Shape** | Open, accessible | Choose **open‑blooming** varieties that are easy to enter. |

> **Tip:** Create a *bee garden* with a mix of early, mid, and late‑season blooms to keep them busy all year.

## Australian Native Bees & Wasps

- **Preferred Plants:** *Everlasting daisies*, *eucalyptus*, *callistemon*, *brachycome*, *grevillea*  
- **Species Count:** ~2000, mostly solitary (no hives)  
- **Habitat:** Native grasses, well‑mulched beds, and native shrubs  

> **Action:** Plant a few native species in your beds; they’ll provide a natural habitat and food source.

## Butterflies

| Preference | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Color** | Bold reds, oranges, yellows, pinks, purples |
| **Shape** | Tubular |
| **Scent** | Weak or none |
| **Pollen** | Not needed – they skip pollen |

> **Practical Advice:** Grow **tubular flowers** like *zinnias*, *marigolds*, and *tropical hibiscus* to attract butterflies. Keep them open during daylight.

## Flies (Including Hoverflies & Drone Flies)

| Type | Flower Preference | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| **General Flies** | Faintly scented, day‑open flowers | Active in cooler months; great winter pollinators |
| **Hoverflies** | Bold orange, yellow, white | Often mistaken for bees |
| **Drone Flies** | Bright orange, yellow, white | Produce large nectar volumes |

> **Tip:** Add **brightly colored** flowers like *marigold* and *sunflower* to attract hoverflies and drone flies, especially in late summer.

---

## Beetles (Ladybird Beetles & Others)

- **Color Preference:** Green or white flowers  
- **Pollination Role:** Limited flight range; they crawl or fly short distances, carrying pollen

> **Action:** Include **green‑blossoming** plants such as *cabbage* or *broccoli* to support beetle pollinators.

---

## Nocturnal Pollinators

### Moths

- **Flower Traits:** Small, white or pale, tubular, strong scent (e.g., honeysuckle, jasmine)  
- **Timing:** Open late afternoon or early evening; cluster in abundance

> **Practical Tip:** Plant **night‑scented** flowers like *night-blooming jasmine* or *sweet alyssum* to lure moths.

### Bats

- **Flower Traits:** Large white or pale clusters, sweet scent, high canopy placement  
- **Impact:** Can travel up to 40 km, dispersing pollen and seeds over wide areas

> **Action:** Grow **tall native trees** with white or pale blossoms (e.g., *Eucalyptus* species) to attract bats.

## Boosting Your Garden’s Pollinator Diversity

- **Plant a Variety of Colors & Shapes:** Mix blue, purple, yellow, red, and white blooms.  
- **Stagger Bloom Times:** Ensure some flowers are in bloom each month.  
- **Include Native Species:** They provide the best food and habitat for local pollinators.  
- **Use Mulch & Native Grasses:** Create a welcoming environment for beneficial insects.  
- **Avoid Pesticides:** Let nature do its job; use organic methods if needed.

> **Remember:** Every flower you plant is a potential food source for a different pollinator. A diverse garden equals a thriving ecosystem.
