# 5 Ways to Attract Aphid‑Loving Lacewings to Your Garden

In the ongoing battle against aphids, every extra ally counts. Lacewings are nature’s tiny pest‑hunters, and when you give them a hand, you can keep your plants healthy without relying on harsh chemicals.

## What Are Lacewings?

- **About 5,000 species worldwide** – more than 600 have been recorded in Australia.  
- The most common Australian garden lacewing is **_Mallada signatus_**: a bright green, ~15 mm long, with large lacy wings that fold into an inverted “V.”  
- Brown lacewings are a bit smaller (~8 mm) but share the same delicate, veined wings.  
- Adults are **nocturnal** and love light; they live only 3–4 weeks in the wild, though they may hibernate in cooler climates.  
- Their diet: mainly nectar, pollen, and honeydew, with occasional small insects or eggs.  
- **Lacewing larvae** are the real powerhouses, devouring up to 60 aphids per hour and also tackling caterpillars, mealybugs, psyllids, scale, and lace bugs.

## The Value of Lacewing Larvae

1. **Egg‑laying strategy**  
   - Females deposit eggs on leaf undersides.  
   - Brown lacewings lay directly on the leaf; green lacewings attach eggs to short stalks, protecting them from ant predation.  
   - Eggs can be single or in clusters, rows, or U‑shapes—up to 600 per female over 3–4 weeks.  

2. **Hatching & growth**  
   - Eggs hatch in ~4 days into tiny brown or white larvae with a ridged, alligator‑like body.  
   - Larvae grow to ~15 mm, earning the nickname **“aphid lions.”**  

3. **Hunting method**  
   - Sickle‑shaped jaws pierce aphids, sucking out body fluids.  
   - The empty husk is carried on their backs as camouflage while they hunt the next prey.  

4. **Broader pest control**  
   - Besides aphids, they eat caterpillars, mealybugs, psyllids, scale, and lace bugs—making them a versatile natural enemy.

## How to Attract Lacewings to Your Garden

A thriving lacewing population keeps pests in check. Try these five practical steps together for best results.

### 1. Reduce Chemical Use

- **Avoid** synthetic pyrethroids, organophosphates, and neonicotinoids—they’re toxic to lacewings.  
- If you must spray, choose **selective, targeted products** and apply only where needed.  
- Keep overall chemical use to a minimum to protect lacewings and the wider garden ecosystem.

### 2. Keep Ants Under Control

- Ants and lacewings compete for the same prey (scale, mealybug) but **ant farms aphids** for honeydew, protecting them from lacewing predation.  
- A balanced approach:  
  - Remove ant nests near vegetable beds where aphids thrive.  
  - Leave ant colonies elsewhere to maintain their beneficial roles (pollination, caterpillar control, debris recycling).  

### 3. Provide Suitable Habitat

- Lacewings prefer **raised, sheltered spots** (≈2 m high).  
- Install an **insect hotel** on a wall or tree trunk.  
- Alternatively, create a high, dense hedge or a corner of tall shrubs to offer natural shelter and overwintering sites.

### 4. Grow Companion Plants

- Adult lacewings feed on pollen and nectar; nectar‑rich flowers attract them—and other beneficial insects.  
- **Most attractive flowers**:  
  - *Alyssum, dill, calendula, angelica, golden marguerite, coriander, cosmos, Queen Anne’s lace, yarrow, fennel, tansy,* and *dandelion*.  
- Plant these near aphid‑prone areas to encourage females to lay eggs nearby.

### 5. Tolerate Early Aphids

- Allow a **small initial aphid outbreak** to give lacewings a food source.  
- This encourages passing lacewings to lay eggs, establishing a breeding population.  
- Over time, a resident lacewing community will keep aphid numbers low, reducing the need for insecticides.

By following these steps, you’ll create a garden that naturally balances pest populations, keeping your plants healthy and your chemical use low.
