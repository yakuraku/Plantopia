*Carrot Fly: Controlling Numbers to Protect Your Harvest*

## Recognising the Carrot Fly

- **Scientific name:** _Chamaepsila rosae_ (formerly _Psila rosea_), also called the **carrot rust fly** or **carrot root fly**.  
- **Adult appearance:** Small black fly, ~8 mm long, with transparent wings.  
- **Key culprit:** It’s the *larvae*, not the adults, that damage your crop.

### Life Cycle Snapshot

| Stage | Description | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Eggs** | Laid by females in the soil around target plants (carrots, parsley, parsnip, celeriac, fennel). | 1–2 weeks |
| **Larvae** | Slender, creamy maggots up to 9 mm, with black feeding hooks. They burrow into fine hairy roots and later the tap root. | 1 month+ |
| **Pupae** | Shiny brown, ~5 mm long. | 2–4 weeks |
| **Adults** | Emerge from pupae. | 2–4 weeks |

- Up to **three generations** per year.  
- Overwinter as larvae or pupae, resuming in spring.

## What Damage Do Carrot Flies Cause?

- **Root damage:** Brownish‑black scarring and discoloured tunnels.  
- **Harvest impact:** Heavily infested roots become inedible or unappetising.  
- **Seedling loss:** Young seedlings can be killed before a sturdy root system forms.  
- **Above‑ground signs:** Yellow or bronze leaves on established plants may be the *only* visible symptom.

## Carrot Fly Management and Control

### 1. Prevent Egg Laying

- **Insect‑exclusion netting**  
  - Install immediately after sowing.  
  - Net must extend **at least 5 cm** into the soil to create a full barrier.  
  - Keep in place until harvest; only remove briefly for essential weeding.

### 2. Reduce Larval Food Sources

| Strategy | How It Helps | Tips |
|----------|--------------|------|
| **Sow sparsely** | Fewer plants mean less attraction for females. | If thinning is needed, remove all debris and cover exposed roots with soil. |
| **Raised beds** | Flies stay close to the ground. | Not foolproof—wind‑blown flies can still reach crops. |
| **Mulch** | Discourages egg laying. | Use a thick layer around sown seeds. |
| **Crop rotation** | Overwintering larvae lack food. | Rotate away from all umbellifer family crops. |
| **Late sowing** | Avoid first generation from overwintering. | Sow in late spring or early summer. |
| **Allium companion planting** | Onions, garlic, chives emit scents that deter females. | Surround carrot beds with alliums for maximum effect. |
| **Post‑harvest cleanup** | Removes remaining plant material. | Clear all carrot parts, turn soil during winter to expose larvae/pupae to birds. |

### 3. Monitor and Respond

- **Inspect roots** early in the season for discoloured scars or tunnels.  
- **Act quickly** if you spot damage—remove affected plants to prevent spread.  
- **Use netting** as a first line of defense; combine with other methods for best results.

**Bottom line:** By blocking egg laying and starving the larvae, you can keep carrot fly numbers low and protect your harvest.
