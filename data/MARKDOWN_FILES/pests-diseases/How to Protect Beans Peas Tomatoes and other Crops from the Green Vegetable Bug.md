# How to Protect Beans, Peas, Tomatoes and Other Crops from the Green Vegetable Bug  

**30 August 2025**  

The green vegetable bug (*Nezara viridula*) is a non‑native pest that loves fruit, vegetable and legume crops. Originating in eastern Africa, it now thrives across Australia and the globe, and is also known as the green stink bug or green shield bug.

## What Does the Bug Look Like?

- Bright green adults, sometimes with lighter spots on the body or head  
- 12–15 mm long, broad, flat, shield‑shaped body  
- Long, needle‑like mouthparts for piercing and sucking

## Life Cycle

| Stage | Key Details | Time |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Eggs** | 30–150 laid in a honeycomb mass on the underside of leaves | 5–21 days to hatch (warmer = faster) |
| **Nymphs** | Shiny black, stay near eggs for ~3 days, then molt and start feeding | 5–6 weeks to mature |
| **Moult** | Four molts: black → black‑spotted → green with patterns → final green | Progressive colour change |
| **Adults** | Strong flyers, enter diapause in winter (turn reddish‑brown, hide in cracks) | Continuous breeding in tropics; up to 4 generations per year in temperate zones |

: Eggs. Hatched Black Nymphs (second stage). Juveniles (third stage).  

: Juvenile (fourth stage). Young Adolescent. Mature Adults mating and damage to Broad bean pod.

## Feeding Habits & Damage

- **Diet:** Legumes (favoured), cucurbits, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, sweetcorn, fruit, nuts, some ornamentals  
- **Method:** Pierces plant, sucks sap/juice  
- **Targets:**  
  - *Nymphs* → young shoots & leaves  
  - *Adults* → fruits, pods, seeds  

**Common damage signs**

- Hard, corky growths on tomatoes  
- Shriveling of corn kernels or legumes  
- Cat‑facing on damaged fruit  
- Wilting shoots, mottled & misshapen fruits, premature flower drop, overall reduced vigor

## Spotting the Bug

- Adults are relatively large and easy to see  
- Emit a foul‑smelling liquid when disturbed (defensive spray)  
- Often you’ll notice the damage *before* you spot the bugs  

**Legume clues**

- Aborted pod development  
- Misshapen pods  
- Wet lesions on stalks or leaves

## Managing an Infestation

### Historical Context
- 20th century: major pest of soybean crops  
- Biological control: parasitic wasp *Trissolcus basalis* (effective on commercial farms)

### Home‑garden tactics

| Approach | How to Use | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------------|------|------|
| **Hand removal** | Pick off bugs, eggs, nymphs | Simple | Ineffective when numbers are high; adults fly away |
| **Eco‑friendly spray** | Mix water, horticultural soap, chilli powder, garlic | Suffocates nymphs, repels adults | Requires frequent application |
| **Pyrethrum spray** | Organic, daisy‑derived | Strong against sap‑suckers | Harmful to beneficial insects |
| **Derris dust** | Plant‑root extract dust | Organic | Broad‑spectrum, kills beneficials |

> **Tip:** Use pyrethrum or derris only when necessary; keep beneficial insects in mind.

## Dealing with Infested Plants

- **Mild infestation:** Remove eggs, nymphs, adults; monitor closely.  
- **Severe infestation:**  
  1. Cut the plant down in place.  
  2. Leave it on the soil surface.  
  3. Cover the area with black plastic.  
  4. Let the soil heat up (≥ 35 °C) for a couple of sunny days to kill eggs/bugs.  
  5. Re‑use the area for fresh sowings.

> **Avoid** adding infested material straight to compost to prevent spreading.

## Prevention & Control

| Strategy | Why It Works | How to Implement |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Crop rotation** | Breaks the bug’s life cycle, reduces overwintering adults | Avoid planting legumes or other favourite crops in the same spot year after year |
| **Weed control** | Weeds can host bugs | Thoroughly weed around legumes and susceptible crops |
| **Exclusion netting/bags** | Keeps bugs out of vulnerable fruit/veg | Use from seedling stage; isolate infested plants under netting |
| **Sacrificial decoys** | Rattlepods (Crotalaria) lure bugs away | Plant near but not near grazing animals (some species toxic) |
| **Encourage natural predators** | Ants & ladybird beetle larvae help control nymphs & eggs | Don’t discourage ants unless they become a problem; attract ladybirds |
| **Regular monitoring** | Early detection saves effort | Inspect plants weekly for damage signs and bugs |

*If you grow legumes or other sap‑rich vegetables, the green vegetable bug is almost inevitable. With a bit of vigilance and the right tactics, you can keep the damage to a minimum and enjoy a healthy harvest.*
