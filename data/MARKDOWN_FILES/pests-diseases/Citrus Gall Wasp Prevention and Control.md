# Citrus Gall Wasp: Prevention and Control

30 August 2025  
* **Citrus Gall Wasp: Prevention and Control**

Anyone with a backyard lemon tree in the southern states will recognize the telltale branch swellings caused by the citrus gall wasp. This pest attacks all citrus varieties in Australia—including native finger limes. It originates in Queensland and northern New South Wales, where natural predators keep its numbers in check.  

Unfortunately, the wasp has slowly moved southward into colder climates, and its less cold‑tolerant predators haven’t followed. In the southern states, infestations can grow virtually unchecked, leading to serious impacts on the trees.

> **Key Takeaway:** While the damage is rarely fatal, fruiting can be reduced, growth stunted, and the tree’s appearance marred by unsightly galls.

## Recognising the Citrus Gall Wasp

- **Scientific name:** _Bruchophagus fellis_  
- **Size:** 2–3 mm long (tiny, often invisible)  
- **Life cycle:**  
  - Adult wasps lay eggs in the bark of new citrus growth during spring.  
  - They die 3–14 days later (temperature‑dependent).  
  - A single adult can lay up to **100 eggs**.  
  - Larvae burrow deeper into the stem, feeding on citrus tissue.  
  - The tree reacts by producing extra cells, forming **galls**—small swellings that grow larger, turning grey or brown.  
  - In spring, adults emerge from the galls, leaving tiny exit holes, and start the cycle again.

> **Tip:** Look for small bumps on the bark that grow over time; the exit holes are a clear sign of an active infestation.

## How Damaging Are Citrus Gall Wasps?

- **Fatality:** Rare; most trees survive.  
- **Effects:**  
  - Growth stunted  
  - Fruit yield reduced  
  - Aesthetic damage from galls  
- **Young trees:** If heavily infested, consider uprooting and replanting for better long‑term productivity.  
- **Older trees:** More resilient; a light infestation may be tolerated, but early action prevents spread.

> **Proactive advice:** Treat infestations promptly to avoid garden‑to‑garden spread.

## Management of Citrus Gall Wasp

### 1. Timing
- **Best window:** Late winter, after fruiting has finished but before wasps emerge from galls.

### 2. Pruning
- **Heavy infestations:** Prune branches with many galls entirely.  
  - *Note:* This will reduce next season’s fruit yield because citrus flowers at the branch tips.

### 3. Gall Removal (for fresh galls)
- **Tools:** Razor blade, sharp knife, or potato peeler.  
- **Method:**  
  1. Slice off the outer layer of each gall, exposing the larvae.  
  2. Cut **lengthwise** along one side of the stem—avoid ring‑barking.  
  3. Face the blade away from your body for safety.  
- **When to use:** Only on fresh galls with larvae inside; ignore empty galls to avoid unnecessary tree stress.

### 4. Disposal
- **Solarise** pruned material under a plastic cover, or  
- Seal in a bag and discard with regular rubbish (not compost or green bin).  
  - *Why:* Wasps can fly short distances and may emerge from pruned branches, spreading the pest.

## Citrus Gall Wasp Prevention

After dealing with an infestation, adopt these ongoing practices to keep it from returning.

### 1. Fertilisation
- **Spring:** Use a light touch; wasps prefer juicy new growth.  
- **Autumn:** Apply the bulk of fertiliser.  
- **Alternative:** Delay feeding until summer if possible.

### 2. Pruning Frequency
- **Goal:** Reduce new growth that attracts wasps.  
- **Recommendation:** Prune only every **second year** if feasible.

### 3. Eco‑Oil Application
- **When:** Early spring.  
- **How:** Spray the bark (not foliage).  
- **Effect:** Deters egg‑laying.

### 4. Sticky Traps
- **Placement:** Hang near galls, within the tree canopy—not around the dripline.  
- **Benefit:** Captures emerging adults, breaking the life cycle while minimizing impact on beneficial insects.

**Bottom line:** With attentive monitoring and these practical steps, you can keep citrus gall wasps at bay and enjoy healthy, productive citrus trees for years to come.
