## Why You Should Keep Cats Out of Your Beds

### *Contact With Cat Faeces Can Be Dangerous To Your Health*

Cat droppings are more than just a nuisance—they can carry the parasite **Toxoplasma**.  
- **How it spreads**: Touching the faeces or eating vegetables grown in contaminated soil.  
- **What to watch for**: Fever, headaches, muscle aches, and in severe cases vomiting, diarrhoea, seizures, or confusion.  

Even if you wear gloves while gardening, the real risk is the food you harvest. Wash or cook your produce thoroughly to stay safe.  
**Bottom line:** Preventing cats from using your beds is the simplest way to protect your health and your harvest.

## 1. Talk To Your Neighbours

If you know where the offending cat lives, a friendly chat can do wonders.  
- **Why it works**: Many owners don’t realize their pet is roaming your yard.  
- **How to approach**: Be polite, mention the problem, and suggest simple fixes (e.g., keeping the cat indoors or providing a litter box outside).

## 2. Call Your Local Council

If a neighbour‑talk doesn’t help, reach out to your council.  
- **What they can do**: Many Australian councils enforce cat‑containment laws that keep cats from roaming freely.  
- **Tip**: Check your local regulations first—this lets the council handle the situation without you having to confront the owner directly.

## 3. Use Strong Scents To Deter Cats

Cats have a keen sense of smell and dislike certain scents. Try these safe, garden‑friendly options:

### Citrus Fruits  
- **Method**: Bury lemon or orange peels in the soil or spray a mix of citrus juice and water around beds.  
- **Benefit**: Adds nutrients while keeping cats away.

### Cinnamon  
- **Method**: Sprinkle a thin layer around plants.  
- **Why it works**: Cats avoid the strong aroma.

### Banana Peels  
- **Method**: Bury peels just below the surface.  
- **Benefit**: Adds potassium to the soil and deters cats.

### Chicken Manure  
- **Method**: Spread a thin layer of fresh manure.  
- **Why it works**: The strong smell repels cats, and it’s a powerful fertilizer.

## 4. Use Mulch To Cover The Soil

A rough surface makes digging unpleasant for cats.  
- **Materials**:  
  - Coarse bark or wood chips  
  - Pine needles  
  - Gravel or small stones  
- **Extra tip**: Keep beds well‑watered—wet soil is less appealing to cats.

## 5. Add Some Plants That Cats Don’t Like

Certain plants naturally repel felines due to their scent or texture.

### Rosemary  
- **Why**: Strong aroma and slightly prickly leaves.  
- **Bonus**: Keeps other pests away and is a kitchen staple.

### Lavender  
- **Why**: Sweet scent that intensifies when brushed.  
- **Planting tip**: Grow on a raised mound to avoid soggy roots.

### Curry Plant (Helichrysum italicum)  
- **Why**: Emits a pleasant curry fragrance when touched.  
- **Use**: Adds visual interest and a culinary aroma.

## 6. Block Access To Your Garden Beds

Physical barriers are highly effective.

- **Fence + Mesh Roof**: Use chicken wire or a low fence with a roof to enclose beds.  
- **Crop Covers**: Commercial covers protect vegetables and keep birds out.  
- **Sticks in Soil**: Insert vertical sticks at regular intervals to create a difficult path for cats.

## 7. Scare The Cats Away

Cats dislike being watched while they do their business.

- **Spot the Cat**: Keep an eye out during the day.  
- **Approach**: Walk loudly toward it—no need to be aggressive.  
- **Water Spray**: A quick burst from a hose can startle them (use sparingly and kindly).

## 8. Additional Deterrent Methods

For a tech‑savvy twist, consider these humane options:

### Ultrasonic Repellers  
- Emit high‑frequency sounds irritating to cats but inaudible to humans.

### Motion‑Activated Sprinklers  
- Detect movement and spray a gentle burst of water—startles cats without harming them.

### Visual Deterrents  
- Hang reflective tape or old CDs to create unpredictable flashes that cats dislike.
