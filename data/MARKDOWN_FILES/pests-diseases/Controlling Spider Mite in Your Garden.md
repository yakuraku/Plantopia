## Identifying Spider Mites and the Damage They Cause

- **Size & look** – Individual mites are about **½ mm long** with **eight legs**.  
  - In spring/summer: *yellow‑orange* with a darker spot on each side.  
  - In autumn: shift to a deeper **red** that blends with foliage.

- **How they feed** – They pierce the underside of leaves and suck sap.  
  - The tiny punctures are hard to see, but the cumulative effect is huge.  
  - Leaves feel dry and slightly sandpapery on the lower side.

- **Visible signs**  
  - *Stippling*: tiny yellow or white mottles that spread across both leaf surfaces.  
  - Leaves turn **yellow → bronze → drop**.  
  - Fine, spider‑webbing appears, especially on the underside when numbers rise.

- **Early warning** – Look for stippling and webbing before the plant shows severe yellowing.  
  - A magnifying glass can reveal colonies that are large enough to see.

## Spider Mite Life Cycle

- **Rapid reproduction** – In hot, dry conditions a mite can go from egg to egg‑laying adult in **as little as two weeks**.  
- **Eggs** – Up to **300 per female** on leaf undersides.  
- **Overwintering** – Eggs can survive on foliage and hatch in spring.  
- **Dispersal** – Adult mites hitch rides on wind, clothing, or tools, spreading to new plants.

## Plants at Risk

Spider mites attack **over 200 species**. Common targets include:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Fruits** | Soft fruits, berries, apples, pears |
| **Vegetables** | Potatoes, cucumbers, peas, beans, tomatoes, salad greens |
| **Flowers** | Viola, marigold, impatiens, salvia |
| **Shrubs & Trees** | Azalea, roses, many others |

> **Tip:** If your garden has at least one of these, it’s likely at risk.

## Prevention, Control, and Treatment

Because spider mites reproduce so quickly, **early action** is essential. Chemical options are limited and can harm beneficial insects, so focus on **non‑chemical** methods first.

### 1. Keep Plants Healthy

- **Water wisely** – Avoid both underwatering and overwatering.  
- **Soil fertility** – Grow in nutrient‑rich soil, but **don’t over‑fertilise** in warm weather; new growth attracts mites.

### 2. Regular Inspection

- **Weekly checks** – Look for discoloration, stippling, and webbing.  
- **Magnifying glass** – If you suspect an infestation, examine the leaf undersides closely.

### 3. Mechanical Removal

- **Water jet** – A strong spray can dislodge mild infestations.  
- **Handheld vacuum** – Gently suck up mites from leaves.

### 4. Prune Affected Parts

- Remove heavily infested leaves or stems to protect the rest of the plant.

### 5. Increase Humidity

- **Misting** – Frequently mist leaf undersides.  
- **Water containers** – Place shallow trays of water near plants.  
  - Higher humidity discourages mites and supports their natural predators, especially under cover.

### 6. Eco‑Oil Spray

- **Application** – Spray infested plants with eco‑oil to suffocate adults and prevent egg hatching.  
- **Frequency** – Repeat as needed until the population drops.

### 7. Wettable Sulphur

- **Use** – Spray over the entire plant to kill mites without harming the ecosystem.  
- **Caution** – Apply more than once if necessary.  
- **Do not confuse** with lime sulphur (used for soil pH); lime sulphur can burn leaves.

### 8. Greenhouse & Container Hygiene

- Clean tools, pots, and surrounding areas to reduce overwintering sites and keep numbers low year‑to‑year.

## When Pesticides Are Unavoidable

- **Last resort** – If natural methods fail, consider pesticides.  
- **Professional help** – Call a pest‑control specialist to apply treatments with minimal side effects.

**Quick recap:**  
- Spot early with weekly checks.  
- Keep plants healthy and humid.  
- Use mechanical removal, eco‑oil, or wettable sulphur before resorting to chemicals.  
- Act fast, and your garden can stay mite‑free without heavy damage.
