# Fertiliser: Why, When and How to Use It
============================

**11 November 2023**

A healthy soil packed with nutrients is the foundation of a thriving garden. Yet many gardens—especially those with sandy soils or in suburban areas where the ground has been disturbed—lack natural fertility. Even the best soils can lose nutrients over time as you harvest vegetables or cut flowers, preventing the plant matter from being recycled back into the earth.  

While composting and green manures are excellent long‑term solutions, there are moments when a quick, reliable nutrient boost is essential. Fertiliser can fill that gap—but using it incorrectly can harm plants and the environment. Below is a practical guide to help you decide *when* and *how* to fertilise.

## Do You Really Need a Fertiliser?

- **If your plants are already thriving**  
  *A layer of compost or aged animal manure at the start of each season usually suffices.*  
  You’re likely getting enough nutrients from natural sources, so extra fertiliser may be unnecessary.

- **If you notice signs of deficiency**  
  *Poor growth, discoloured or yellowing leaves, leaf drop, or low yields* are red flags. In these cases, a targeted fertiliser can make a noticeable difference.

> **Tip:** Over‑fertilising can lead to *excessive tender growth*, *fertiliser burn*, and increased pest susceptibility. It can also cause nitrogen runoff, contributing to algal blooms in waterways.

## Which Fertiliser Should You Use?

Fertilisers contain three core nutrients—**nitrogen (N)**, **phosphorus (P)**, and **potassium (K)**—each influencing plant growth in distinct ways:

- **Potassium (K)**  
  *Promotes flower formation*—essential for crops like tomatoes and peppers.

- **Phosphorus (P)**  
  *Supports overall plant vigour* and is especially useful for root vegetables.  
  *Caution:* High levels can harm many Australian native plants.

- **Nitrogen (N)**  
  *Boosts leafy growth* and early development.

**Choosing the right blend**

- For most gardens, a *general‑purpose fertiliser* with a balanced NPK ratio works well.
- For specific crops, look for a formula *tailored to that plant’s needs* (e.g., a tomato‑specific blend).

## Fast‑Acting or Slow‑Release Fertilisers?

| Type | Typical Form | Release Rate | Best Use |
|------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Fast‑acting** | Liquid, soluble powders | Immediate | Correcting a sudden deficiency or giving a quick boost |
| **Slow‑release** | Pellets, granules, organic powders | Gradual | Sustained feeding over weeks or months |

- **Fast‑acting**: Ideal when you need a *quick response*—for example, a sudden drop in leaf colour or a wilting plant.
- **Slow‑release**: Provides a *steady nutrient supply*, reducing the risk of over‑feeding and simplifying routine care.

## When Should You Apply Fertiliser?

| Timing | Why It Matters | Practical Tips |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Before the growing season** | Gives plants a head start, especially with nitrogen‑rich formulas. | Apply 2–3 weeks before planting to allow nutrients to settle. |
| **Late autumn or winter** | Allows slow‑release fertilisers to enrich the soil before spring. | Avoid applying just before expected frosts or extreme heat. |
| **During flowering (e.g., tomatoes, peppers)** | Potassium‑rich feeds encourage more flowers and better fruit set. | Feed every 2–3 weeks after the first flower appears. |
| **After flowering (bulbs)** | Replenishes nutrient stores for next year’s growth. | Fertilise once the flower fades but leaves remain. |
| **Container plants** | Soil volume is limited and nutrients leach quickly. | Feed consistently throughout the season; follow label rates closely. |

> **Pro Tip:** Always read the label and follow the recommended dosage. Over‑application can be as harmful as under‑feeding.

## Bottom Line

Fertiliser isn’t a habit‑forming product; it’s a tool that, when used thoughtfully, can dramatically improve plant health and yields. By matching the right type of fertiliser to your garden’s needs and applying it at the right time, you’ll support robust growth while protecting the environment.
