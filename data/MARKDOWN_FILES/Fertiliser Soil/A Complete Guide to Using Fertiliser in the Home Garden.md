# A Complete Guide to Using Fertiliser in the Home Garden

---

## 1) Introduction: The Need for Fertiliser  
Plants require **four essentials** to thrive: sunlight, carbon dioxide, water, and nutrients.  
- In nature, soil naturally replenishes nutrients as plant and animal waste decomposes.  
- In a garden, harvesting flowers, crops, or removing plant material breaks this cycle, gradually depleting soil fertility.  
- Many garden plants are *non‑native* or *hungry* compared to their wild counterparts, so the soil’s natural balance often falls short.  

**Bottom line:** A typical garden soil can benefit from a little extra nutrition—enter fertiliser.

## 2) What is a Fertiliser?  
A fertiliser is a **concentrated nutrient source** applied to soil or plants to boost growth, yields, or flower displays.  
- It’s *not* a magic cure‑all; it won’t fix pH, drainage, or pest problems.  
- Using the wrong type can harm plants or encourage unwanted growth.  
- When chosen correctly, fertiliser is a powerful tool in any gardener’s kit.

## 3) Fertiliser Sources  
### Organic Fertilisers  
- Derived from plant or animal material (bone meal, chicken manure, seaweed, etc.).  
- Nutrients are bound in complex molecules → **slow release** over weeks/months.  
- Great for steady feeding and improving soil structure (especially powdered or pellet forms).  
- *Note:* “Organic” only means plant/animal origin; it doesn’t guarantee eco‑friendliness or certification.  

### Synthetic (Mineral) Fertilisers  
- Produced chemically from minerals, industrial by‑products, or synthesized ammonia.  
- Nutrients are in pure, readily absorbed form → **fast‑acting**.  
- Ideal for quick fixes or boosting yields, but offer little benefit to soil structure and can leach quickly in wet conditions.  
- Many commercial blends combine organic and synthetic components for balanced performance.

## 4) Fertiliser Nutrient Content  
### Primary Elements  
| Element | Function | Typical Need |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Nitrogen (N)** | Promotes green foliage & rapid leafy growth | Highest requirement |
| **Phosphorous (P)** | Drives root & shoot development; boosts fruit/seed health | Key for photosynthesis |
| **Potassium (K)** | Enhances flowering, fruiting, stem strength, and hardiness | Vital for overall vigor |

### N:P:K Ratio  
- The ratio on packaging shows the **percentage** of each nutrient.  
- Numbers rarely add to 100%; the remainder is inert filler (sand, perlite).  
- **Examples:**  
  - *10:10:10* – balanced, all‑round nutrition.  
  - *5:10:15* – higher K, good for tomatoes (flowering/fruiting).  
  - *15:10:5* – high N, ideal for grass or leafy greens.

### Secondary Nutrients  
- **Calcium (Ca)** – aids nutrient uptake & disease resistance.  
- **Magnesium (Mg)** – essential for photosynthesis & P availability.  
- **Sulphur (S)** – builds amino acids.  
  - Most commercial feeds already contain a suitable mix; compost and mulch usually cover any gaps.

### Trace Elements  
- Zinc, iron, copper, boron, nickel, manganese, etc.  
  - Needed in tiny amounts; a broad mix is usually fine unless a specific deficiency is known.

## 5) Fertiliser Forms  
| Form | How It Works | Typical Use | Frequency |
|------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Powders & Granular** | Spread on soil surface or worked in; water in | General feeding | Every 1–2 months |
| **Pellets** | Larger granules → slower degradation | Long‑term feeding | Less frequent |
| **Soluble** | Dissolved in water before use | Quick boost, irrigation | More frequent |
| **Liquid** | Highly concentrated, diluted before use | Rapid absorption | Similar to soluble |

> **Safety tip:** Synthetic products can irritate skin. Wear gloves when handling powders or pellets.

## 6) Nutrient Release Speeds  
| Speed | Typical Source | How It Works | Best For |
|-------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **Fast‑Acting** | Synthetic or liquid | Immediate availability | Correcting deficiencies, emergency feeding |
| **Slow‑Release** | Organic | Micro‑organisms break down nutrients | Spring application, steady feeding |
| **Controlled‑Release** | Inorganic granules with semi‑permeable coating | Gradual leaching | Matching plant life cycle, long‑term feeding |

---

## 7) Application Methods  
| Method | What It Is | Ideal For | Tips |
|--------|------------|-----------|------|
| **Top Dressing** | Spread solid/fine fertiliser over soil surface | Early season start, tomatoes | Follow label; avoid direct contact with foliage |
| **Base Dressing** | Mix fertiliser into soil before sowing/transplanting | Poor soils, early foliage boost | Use slow‑release for steady supply |
| **Watering On** | Dissolve liquid or powder in water, water around base | Containers, indoor plants | Don’t over‑concentrate; avoid splashing |
| **Foliar Feeding** | Dilute fertiliser, spray on leaves | Rapid deficiency rescue | Use tender foliage; avoid sunny days to prevent scorch |

## 8) When to Apply Fertiliser  
1. **Time of Year** – Match nutrient needs to growth stages:  
   - *Spring:* Nitrogen‑rich for early growth.  
   - *Summer:* Potassium‑rich to encourage flowering.  
   - *Autumn:* Phosphorous‑rich to strengthen roots for winter.  

2. **Stage of Growth** – Feed when the plant will benefit most (e.g., tomatoes get K every 2 weeks once flowering starts).  

3. **Emergency Measures** – Spot‑feed when signs of deficiency appear (pale leaves = N deficiency, weak leaves = Fe/Mg deficiency).  

4. **Containers** – Fertilise more frequently but lightly, as nutrients leach out quickly.

> **Pro tip:** Avoid routine fertilising in fertile soils; it’s wasteful and can harm plants.

## 9) Fertiliser vs Soil Management  
- **Synthetic fertilisers**: Quick fixes, no soil improvement.  
- **Organic fertilisers**: Improve soil structure but still need good management.  
- **Long‑term strategy:** Build soil with compost, green manures, and mulch.  
- **Result:** Healthy soil + targeted fertiliser = optimal plant performance.
