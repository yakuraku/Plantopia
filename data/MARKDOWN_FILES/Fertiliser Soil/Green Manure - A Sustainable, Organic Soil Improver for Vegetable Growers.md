## What Is Green Manure?  
*Also called a compost crop or a fallow‑cycle crop,* green manure is a plant grown **solely to improve soil quality** before the next productive crop.  
- Usually sown during a patch’s downtime (winter or a rotation break).  
- Most varieties finish in a few months, but some can protect soil for longer periods.  

## Why Green Manure Matters  
The first advantage is **fast ground cover**:  
- Suppresses weeds  
- Reduces erosion  
- Slows nutrient leaching  

Other benefits:  
- **Improves soil texture** through vigorous root growth and the addition of organic matter when the crop is incorporated.  
- Attracts pollinators; some, like rocket, help keep soil disease in check.  
- **Nitrogen management** – the most prized benefit for vegetable growers.  

### Fixers and Lifters  
| Type | How It Works | What It Does |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Fixers** (e.g., peas, beans) | Root bacteria (*rhizobia*) convert atmospheric nitrogen into plant‑available forms. | Adds nitrogen to the soil when the plant dies. |
| **Lifters** (e.g., buckwheat, mustard) | Absorb excess nitrogen, storing it in plant tissue and releasing it slowly as the plant decays. | Stabilises nitrogen levels for sensitive crops, preventing “green but unproductive” growth. |

## Popular Green Manure Crops  
*(Choose based on your goals: weed suppression, nitrogen action, or soil texture.)*  

- **Broad Beans** – vigorous legume, excellent nitrogen fixer, adds organic matter.  
- **Mustard Greens** – top nitrogen lifter, grows rapidly, economical for large areas.  
- **Buckwheat** – quick, insect‑attracting, lifts nitrogen, pulls phosphates to the surface.  
- **Fenugreek** – fastest cycle (~10 weeks), great for a quick boost.  
- **Clover** – long‑term cover, flowers attract beneficial insects.  
- **Alfalfa** – deep roots improve texture, brings nutrients upward.  
- **Corn Salad** – highly prolific, fast‑growing.  
- **Radish** – germinates quickly, provides leafy green matter.  

*Tip:* A pre‑made seed mix combines these benefits and can be planted in any rotation slot without dominance issues.  

## How to Grow Green Manure  
1. **Prepare the soil** – weed out, rake, and fine‑texture the surface.  
2. **Sow the seeds** – scatter evenly; no need for precise drills.  
3. **Optional boost** – add a layer of well‑rotted animal manure or compost.  
4. **Timing** –  
   - Fast growers: harvest at flowering.  
   - Slow growers: leave longer.  
   - *Avoid seed set* unless you want the plant to act as a future weed.  
5. **Incorporate** –  
   - Small plants: turn into soil with a fork.  
   - Larger plants: mow, then dig in.  
   - Very large plants: shred or strim before incorporation.  
   - Tough or woody species: compost them.  
6. **Rest period** – allow ~6 weeks after digging in before sowing the next crop to let any allelopathic effects fade.
