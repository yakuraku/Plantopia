*Taking a Summer Holiday? How to Help Your Garden Survive Your Absence*

Gardening can be a blissful escape, but even the most passionate green‑thumbed gardener needs a break. Summer holidays often arrive when the plants are at their peak, the heat is intense, and your attention is most required. How can you keep your garden thriving while you’re away?

## Recruit a Caretaker

If possible, ask a housemate, friend, or family member to **watch over your garden**. They can:

- Water regularly  
- Pull a few weeds  
- Check for pests  
- Harvest a few crops as a thank‑you

If you can’t enlist outside help, the key is to **prepare the garden in advance** so that little needs to be done while you’re gone. Below is a quick checklist of the most important tasks.

## 1. Plan Your Harvests

Don’t let your hard work go to waste. Harvest a little before you leave to enjoy the fruits of your labor and to keep plants from seeding.

- **Lettuce, salad leaves, soft herbs** – These are edible even when still small. Harvest early to prevent them from going to seed in the heat.
- **Leafy crops** – Cut back a few leaves or the whole plant to give a pre‑departure harvest. This slows growth for a few weeks, allowing a second crop after you return.  
  *Examples:* silverbeet, rocket, Chinese cabbage, kale, and other leafy veg.
- **Unripe tomatoes** – Pick them and let them ripen off the vine. If nearly ripe, take them home or give them to friends.  
  *Tip:* Store greener tomatoes in a cool, dry place out of direct light; they’ll likely finish ripening when you’re back.
- **Surplus produce** – If you harvest more than you can eat, give the extras away rather than letting them spoil.

## 2. Plan Your Planting

Avoid sowing or transplanting seedlings right before you leave. New plants need daily care to establish.

- **Slow‑germinating herbs** (e.g., parsley) can be scattered just before departure, but always check germination times to avoid tender seedlings appearing while you’re away.
- **Small seedlings in trays or punnets** – Consider taking them to a friend’s house for care, or leave them in the shade on a shallow (1–2 cm) water tray for a few days.

## 3. Tidy Your Garden

A tidy garden is a stress‑free garden. Give it a thorough clean before you go.

- **Weed beds** – Remove all weeds, especially seedlings that could take over while you’re absent.
- **Mulch** – Add a fresh layer to suppress weeds and retain moisture.
- **Support plants early** – Stake tomatoes, train vine tomatoes and cucumbers, and tie in climbers now, even if it’s a little early.
- **Pest check** – Inspect for early signs of pests. If you use slug pellets, homemade sprays, or other treatments, **apply an extra dose** before you leave rather than delaying.

## 4. Prepare Pots and Containers

Pots dry out faster than beds, especially in sunny weather. Reduce water stress with these tricks.

- **Deep saucers** – Place containers in saucers and fill with 3–5 cm of water. This keeps soil moist without roots sitting in water and captures rainfall.
- **Water‑storing granules** – Add to the potting mix or use bottle‑top watering spikes for slow, steady moisture.
- **Shade relocation** – Move pots to shadier spots (under a tree, side of the house) and away from windy areas to cut evaporation.

## 5. Provide Some Temporary Shade

Even sun‑loving plants can benefit from a break from direct light during the hottest part of the day.

- **Shade cloth or heavy netting** – Support with garden canes over the veggie patch.
- **Old beach umbrella** – Position it to block the sun during peak heat.

## 6. Watering the Garden

If you can’t rely on rain, take steps to keep beds from drying out.

- **Deep watering** – Water beds thoroughly before you leave to build a moisture reserve.
- **Irrigation check** – Test any irrigation system or timed sprinklers well in advance.
- **Soil wetters** – Treat beds with a soil wetter or conditioner. Commercial products are available, or a splash of horticultural soap can work just as well.

## 7. Indoor Plants

Don’t forget the houseplants.

1. **Water thoroughly** – Ensure the soil is fully wet, then let the pots drain so roots aren’t sitting in water.
2. **Moisture retention** – Group pot plants and place them on a wet towel in a plugged sink or bath.  
   *Tip:* Avoid direct sunlight; a bathroom is usually cooler and offers more shade, but make sure light‑loving plants aren’t left in deep gloom.

By following these steps, you’ll leave your garden in the best possible shape to survive your absence, letting you relax and enjoy your break with peace of mind.
