# Sweet Potatoes – A Versatile and Tasty Crop

> **30 August 2025**  
> *Sweet Potatoes – A Versatile and Tasty Crop*  
> (_Ipomoea batatas_) grow as trailing vines and are prized for their **starchy, flavorful tubers**.

> *Did you know?* Sweet potatoes belong to the **morning‑glory family (Convolvulaceae)**, not the potato or nightshade family. That means their leaves are **non‑toxic** and can be cooked and eaten just like the tubers—making them a truly dual‑purpose garden plant.

Sweet potatoes are a breeze to grow. They develop underground tubers during the warmer months. Simply plant cuttings or slips from a sprouting tuber in spring, and you’ll have a harvest in **4–6 months**.

## Types of Sweet Potato

Australia grows four main varieties, each with its own texture, flavor, and color palette:

| Color | Variety | Skin | Flesh | Flavor Notes |
|-------|---------|------|-------|--------------|
| **Gold** | *Beauregard* | Golden | Orange | Sweet, buttery |
| **Red** | *Northern Star* | Red | White | Sweet, nutty |
| **Purple** | *Eclipse* | White | Purple | Mild, slightly sweet |
| **White** | – | – | White | Drier, mild, nutty |

> **Tip:** The purple flesh can vary in intensity, and the skin may pick up a hint of color as it matures.

## Kitchen Uses

### 1. Cooking with the Leaves

- **Harvest** young leaves early in the season.
- **Use** them like any leafy green: stir‑fry, steam, or add to soups and curries.

> **Important:** Regular potato leaves are *toxic*—never eat them. If you’re unsure, skip the leaves. Sweet‑potato leaves look similar to potato leaves, so double‑check before cooking.

### 2. Cooking with the Tubers

Sweet‑potato tubers shine in a variety of preparations:

- **Boiled or steamed** – simple, healthy.
- **Roasted or baked** – bring out natural sweetness.
- **Fried or baked fries/chips** – season with salt, or spice it up with cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin, or chili for a kick.

**Quick Soup Idea:**  
Sauté onion and garlic in oil until soft. Add cubed sweet potato and a dash of cumin. Pour in chicken or vegetable stock, simmer until tender, then blend until smooth. Finish with a splash of cream or butter for richness.

> **Pro tip:** Boiled or roasted sweet potatoes can be mashed and turned into dips, pie fillings, or savory spreads.
