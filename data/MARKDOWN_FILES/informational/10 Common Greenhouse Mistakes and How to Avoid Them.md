# 10 Common Greenhouse Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them)

===============================
30 August 2025

Greenhouses are a dream for many gardeners: they let you stretch the growing season, protect delicate species, and create a cozy, muggy workspace.  
But even the best‑planned greenhouse can fall short if you slip into a few common pitfalls. Below, we break down the top mistakes and give you clear, actionable fixes so your greenhouse thrives from day one.

---

## 1. Overcrowding Your Greenhouse

* **Why it hurts** – Tight spaces make it hard to move, prune, or water. Poor air circulation stresses plants and invites disease.
* **What to do** –  
  * Plan for *mature* plant size, not the seedling stage.  
  * Leave at least 0.5 m between rows for most crops.  
  * Use vertical supports (trellises, stakes) to free floor space.

---

## 2. Not Planning for Future Growth

* **The trick** – Plants grow, so your layout must anticipate that expansion.  
* **Practical tip** –  
  * **Cucumbers**:  
    * *No trellis*: 1–2 m² per plant.  
    * *With trellis*: 0.5–0.8 m² per plant—save floor space and boost yields.  
  * Adjust spacing for all crops based on their final height and spread.

## 3. Providing Insufficient Ventilation

* **Why it matters** – Stagnant air fuels bacteria, fungi, and powdery mildew; it also hampers pollen transfer.  
* **Fixes** –  
  * Open windows/doors when possible.  
  * Install fans if the greenhouse is wind‑shielded.  
  * Aim for at least 10–15 % of the greenhouse volume to be exchanged per hour.

## 4. Failing to Manage Temperature Properly

* **Ideal ranges** –  
  * Daytime: **21–29 °C** for most crops.  
  * Nighttime: **13–18 °C** to encourage healthy growth.  
  * Tropical plants can handle higher temps; temperate crops may suffer above 30 °C.  
* **Tools & tactics** –  
  * Use a high‑quality digital thermometer.  
  * **Heat**: heaters, heat mats, or solar blankets.  
  * **Cool**: shade cloths, evaporative cooling, or increased airflow.

## 5. Ignoring Pests

* **Reality check** – Greenhouses are not pest‑proof; they can trap pests and block their natural predators.  
* **Common culprits** – whiteflies, thrips, fungus gnats, aphids, caterpillars, slugs, snails.  
* **Integrated approach** –  
  * Traps (sticky, pheromone).  
  * Organic sprays (Neem, insecticidal soap).  
  * Conventional insecticides only when necessary.  
  * Act quickly—early intervention stops problems from spiraling.

## 6. Maintaining Improper Humidity Levels

* **Target range** – **40–60 % RH** for most plants; up to **80 %** for rainforest species; down to **< 50 %** for succulents and many herbs.  
* **Raising humidity** –  
  * Add a decorative water feature.  
  * Mist plants that need it.  
  * Avoid over‑reducing ventilation—still need airflow.  
* **Lowering humidity** –  
  * Increase ventilation or open windows.  
  * Use dehumidifiers if needed.

## 7. Allowing the Greenhouse to Get Dirty

* **Why cleanliness matters** – Filth fosters bacteria, fungi, and disease outbreaks (e.g., damping off in lettuce, rot in strawberries).  
* **Weekly routine** –  
  * Put items back in their places.  
  * Wipe surfaces with a mild disinfectant (keep away from plants).  
  * Disinfect tools after each use.  
* **Floor care** – Sweep regularly; mop monthly.  
* **Long‑term** – Replace fan filters and clean vents.

---

## 8. Providing Improper Amounts of Light

* **Sun orientation** – Position the greenhouse to capture the sun’s path; avoid shading by nearby trees or buildings.  
* **Too little light** – Consider shade‑tolerant crops (radishes, lettuce) or add grow lights.  
* **Too much light** – Use shade cloths, reflective surfaces, or louvered panels.  
* **Heat vs. light** – Polycarbonate panels let ~90 % of light through while diffusing heat, reducing hot spots.

---

## 9. Ignoring Plant Placement Inside the Greenhouse

* **Micro‑climate matters** – Light, airflow, temperature, and soil chemistry can vary across the greenhouse.  
* **Example** – Carrots vs. beetroot:  
  * Carrots need full sun; beetroot tolerates shade.  
  * Plant carrots in the brightest spot, beetroot in the shadier area.  
* **Other factors** –  
  * Keep heat‑tolerant plants near vents.  
  * Group similar soil‑pH needs together.

---

## 10. Ignoring Soil Health

* **Ground‑grown plants** – Soil nutrients (N, P, K) decline; pH and salinity shift; pathogens build up; compaction worsens root growth.  
* **Prevent compaction** –  
  * Create dedicated pathways or stepping stones.  
  * Aerate with a fork or aerator.  
* **Crop rotation** – Even inside a greenhouse, rotate families to break disease cycles.  
* **Replenish nutrients** –  
  * **Compost** – Add a few inches annually; mix into the top layer.  
  * **Well‑rotted manure** – From cows, horses, or chickens; boosts nitrogen.  
  * **Cover crops** – Clover, buckwheat; improve structure and add nutrients when tilled back in.

> **Bottom line** – Setting up a greenhouse is thrilling, but it demands thoughtful planning and consistent care. Many of the issues above are hard to fix once they’re entrenched, so **plan ahead, monitor closely, and act quickly**. Happy growing!
