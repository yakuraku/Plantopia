## 1. Warm‑Up & Body Care

- **Gentle warm‑ups** before you dig or lift help prevent back pain.

## 2. Protective Gear

### **Skin**

- **Sun‑smart**: Australia’s UV levels are high.  
  - *Slip, slop, slap, seek, slide*:  
    - **Slip** on a long‑sleeved shirt.  
    - **Slop** on sunscreen (SPF 30+).  
    - **Slap** on a wide‑brim hat.  
    - **Seek** shade during peak hours.  
    - **Slide** on sunglasses.  
- Wear **long sleeves & trousers** to guard against scratches and insect bites.  
- **Hydrate**—drink plenty of water, especially on hot days.

### **Eyes**

- **Sunglasses** protect from UV glare.  
- For **power tools** (chainsaw, hedge trimmer, mower, etc.) use **safety goggles** or a **face shield**.  
  - Goggles block dust, debris, and puncture risks.  
  - Many models fit over glasses and vent to prevent fogging.  
- Keep a few pairs handy for different tasks.

### **Ears**

- **Noise** from mowers, blowers, and weed eaters can damage hearing.  
- Use **ear defenders, ear muffs, or ear plugs** (15–30 dB reduction).  
- **Ear plugs** offer more protection and are cooler for hot weather.  
- If reusable, **disinfect** regularly to avoid bacterial buildup.

### **Hands**

- **Gloves** protect against cuts, abrasions, insect bites, and soil pathogens.  
  - **Cotton gloves**: light tasks, sun protection.  
  - **Leather gloves**: heavy work, stone handling.  
  - **All‑purpose breathable gloves** (latex or rubberised): good grip, cut‑resistant, flexible.  
  - **Disposable nitrile/latex/vinyl**: seed work, fine touch.  
  - **Rubber gloves**: chemical handling.  
- Keep up‑to‑date with **tetanus shots**.  
- **Wash** hands and nails after soil contact.

### **Lungs**

- **Masks/respirators** filter dust, pollen, spores, bacteria, and fumes.  
- If you have allergies, a **filter mask** reduces pollen exposure.  
- **Open potting mix** bags in a well‑ventilated area; avoid breathing in the dust.  
- **Dust masks** work for mowing; **respirators** are needed for chemical mixing.

## 3. Using Equipment Safely

| Tool | Tips |
|------|------|
| **Hand tools** (secateurs, forks, spades, rakes) | Use the right tool for the job; keep them ergonomic. Store sharp tools in a belt‑clip holster, not in pockets. |
| **Ladders** | Secure before use. Never stand on the top rung. Keep **three points of contact**. |
| **Chainsaws & hedge trimmers** | Get proper training. Follow safety procedures. Wear full PPE (helmet, goggles, gloves, hearing protection). |
| **Lawn mowers & weed eaters** | Wear **enclosed shoes** or safety boots with steel toes. Long trousers protect legs. Avoid mowing slopes or pulling the mower toward you. Keep eyes protected. Watch for hot engine parts. For corded tools, keep cords clear of foot traffic. Ride‑on mowers: drive slowly, especially when turning. |
| **Sprays & chemicals** | Always wear PPE: long sleeves, trousers or coveralls, chemical‑impervious gloves, goggles, and a respirator. Handle concentrated mixes with extra care. Read the **Safety Data Sheet (SDS)** for disposal instructions. Wash contaminated clothing separately. |

## 4. Staying Safe Around Garden Critters

Gardens attract wildlife—some harmless, some dangerous. Knowing what to watch for helps you avoid bites and stings.

### **Biting & Stinging Insects**

- **Mosquitoes**: Wear long sleeves, use insect repellent, and eliminate standing water.  
- **Sand flies / biting midges**: Found in damp mulch or moist areas. Avoid gardening in early morning or late afternoon. Use protective clothing and repellent. If bitten, apply antihistamine cream or take an antihistamine pill; avoid scratching.

### **Spiders**

- Most spiders are harmless.  
- Wear gloves and closed shoes.  
- Check under furniture, logs, and rocks before sitting or moving items.  
- Remove shoes before going indoors and inspect them for spiders.

### **Snakes**

- **Know your local species**: which are venomous, where they hide, and their habits.  
- Keep the garden tidy: prune shrubs, mow regularly, and remove debris piles.  
- Control rodent populations to reduce snake food sources.  
- Wear sturdy gloves, shoes, and trousers.  
- If you encounter a snake, stay calm, keep distance, and call a professional if needed.
