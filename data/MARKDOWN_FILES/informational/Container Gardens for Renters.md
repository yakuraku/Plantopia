# Container Gardens for Renters

*Container Gardens for Renters*  
*(Bureau of Meteorology)*  

I love scrolling through the BMO site and then skipping around town, whistling and telling random passers‑by that this is the best time of year! Some nod in agreement, others stare like I have three heads. Undeterred, I keep on going.

But let’s not get carried away and plant our spring favourites too early. I’d hate to see my brave little seedlings flattened by a late frost. It’s as hard for me as trying not to touch those Christmas presents labeled with my name under the tree—my chances are slim to none. My excitement has a life of its own, and I’m bound to get swept up in it. I’m basically a three‑year‑old at heart. So instead of fighting that euphoric energy, I’ll focus on other things in my garden while I wait… like mapping out where I’ll fit my fruits, veg, and flowers in my tiny space. Creativity is key.

## The Challenge of Renting

Gardening as a hobby and renting a home don’t always mix. I see vast sunny spots going to waste, overtaken by bindis and noxious weeds. I can’t dig a plot, so I sit with my potted blueberries and brood over the waste. But all is not lost. I’ve learned that almost everything can thrive in a container if you do it right—big trees are the only exception.

I’ve started paying close attention to the soil needs of each plant. For example:

- **Azaleas** love acidic soil, so I create a special mix just for them.  
- **Carrots** thrive in sandy soil and grow deep, so a larger pot is essential.

Discovering each plant’s preferred environment is a fun experiment.

## Endless Possibilities (and Low Cost)

Container gardening can be surprisingly inexpensive. I’m saving for a patch of land, so spending hundreds on pots feels ridiculous. Some pots, though beautiful, can be outrageously expensive for the frugal gardener. I used to despair, thinking how I could have a dream garden with nowhere to grow. Necessity is the mother of invention, and a garden is a necessity to me.

**I started looking at everything as a potential vessel for my blooms. Here are some ideas:**

### Tins

Tins from diced‑tomato jars (or any other jar) work wonders when:

1. **Cleaned** and **sterilized**.  
2. **Holes** are punched generously in the bottom.  
3. (Optional) **Wire** is wound through two more holes on the side to create a hanging planter.  
4. **Paint** the tins any colour; a contrasting hue can look spectacular.

*Below is a picture of some tins I’ve recently painted and hung on an old pallet that’s suspended from my patio roof. On the partially shaded side, I have elkhorns hanging. When my seeds germinate and I can pot them into this, it will look amazing, plus it gets full sun and provides privacy from the neighbours! Imagine my Rosie O’Day alyssum in that aqua can!*

I work in a café, so I often find useful items. These tins are a definite favourite for making giant planters with chicken wire.

### Hessian Bag Planters

**INSTRUCTIONS –**  
1. **Obtain** a hessian bag – check a café, Gumtree, or eBay.  
2. **Get** sturdy but bendable chicken wire (I used a black, mid‑range wire from Bunnings for $13; 4 m is plenty).  
3. **Roll** out some chicken wire and place the hessian bag on top, measuring twice the width of the bag. Remove the bag and cut the wire to the correct length. Fold the wire in half height‑wise for extra sturdiness.  
4. **Place** the hessian bag back on the folded wire. Grab either end and form a cylinder around the bag. Tie it together with wire and pliers.  
5. **Fold** the excess hessian over the outside of the cylinder—looks like a limp laundry hamper.  
6. **Position** the hessian hamper where you want it to stay. It can be heavy and awkward to move.  
7. **Fill** with soil, compost, mulch, and chook pellets in a lasagna style, matching the plant you plan to grow. Remember, a hessian bag with wet soil will break down—use seasonal plants that need replacing once their time is up.  
8. **Plant** your seeds or seedlings and watch them flourish.

*Below are three planters I recently made. They’re waiting for their various veg seedlings to be transplanted when spring hits!*

### Styrofoam Tins

You can find these almost anywhere selling food. They’re free and perfect for herbs and medicinal plants. Punch holes in the bottom, fill a quarter with grit, punch two larger holes on either side, then top with appropriate soil. Paint them if you like.

**Tip:** Don’t move them when fully loaded—they can snap, leaving Styrofoam balls everywhere, which is both annoying and bad for the environment. But they’re free and reusing what would otherwise be rubbish.

You can also turn them into mini greenhouses: place an old glass pane over the top, add ventilation holes, and you’re ready to roll.

## Terracotta Pots

If you’re willing to spend a little, terracotta pots offer amazing value. I recently bought ten 20 cm pots for $25—pretty chipper about that. They retain moisture well in shade but dry out quickly in the sun, so water them frequently during spring and summer.  

**Pro tip:** If a terracotta pot cracks, don’t toss it. Break it carefully and use the pieces as grit or to improve drainage in larger pots. Nothing goes to waste!

- Check Gumtree, local markets, and garage sales for bargains.  
- You can often find great deals on used pots.

## Vertical Gardening

Vertical gardening is gaining traction, and there’s a wealth of information on how to grow a garden vertically. This spring I’m aiming to grow watermelon, rockmelon, eggplant, tomatoes, pumpkins, and passionfruit all vertically in pots. It’s a marathon, but I’m hopeful.

I’ve chosen smaller varieties to reduce strain on the plants. I have old stockings to make fruit hammocks for vines, and plenty of trellising material—old pallets, chicken wire, twine. I have everything I need; I just need patience. Gardening teaches patience over and over again.

*Below are two planter boxes Hubby and I made from old pallets and chicken wire, growing carrots and sugar snap peas.*

## Start Small, Dream Big

My garden has cost mostly time to set up, and I know that can be a real issue for some. Start small and work your way up to big projects like pumpkins on a trellis. Begin with one or two $2.50 terracotta pots and a packet of parsley seeds. There’s nothing more satisfying than watching seeds blossom into beautiful, flourishing plants. It reminds us of the wonder of life.

I might sow a few seeds now… just in case they’re ready.

**Happy almost spring!**
