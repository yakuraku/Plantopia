*Seeds to Sow for a Fabulously Fragrant Garden*

A thriving garden is a treat for all the senses. While most planning focuses on colour, shape, and structure, **fragrance** adds a whole new dimension of joy. Think of a warm summer evening: sudden bursts of scent that transport you to another place, aromas that beckon you deeper into the garden, and pollinators buzzing happily around the most aromatic blooms.  

Below are the most popular and aromatic choices you can sow this season.

## Fragrant Flowers

Whether you love the *controlled chaos* of a cottage garden or prefer a more manicured look, annuals and perennials are the obvious choice for filling your garden with scent.

| **Plant** | **Key Features** | **Scent** |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| **Sweet Peas** | Climbing habit, colourful blooms | Light, vibrant, musky undertone – the scent of summer |
| **Alyssum** | Small white flowers, ground cover | Sweet honey smell, blooms spring‑to‑autumn, great in open ground or containers |
| **Carnations** | Double blooms, wide colour range | Peppery, floral aroma (base for many perfumes) |
| **Four O'Clocks** | Bushy perennial, trumpet‑shaped blooms | Strong floral, citrus scent released in late afternoon |
| **Honesty (Lunaria annua)** | White or purple cross‑shaped blooms, papery seed pods | Beguiling, sweetly floral fragrance in spring/early summer |
| **Sweet William** | Blue‑green foliage, ground‑covering growth | Spicy‑sweet scent with a hint of cloves |
| **Calendula** | Bright orange flowers | Resinous, sap‑like, slightly bitter scent – a nice contrast to other fragrant beds |

## Aromatic Herbs

Herbs are not just for the kitchen; their foliage and blooms fill the air with distinctive scents that also attract pollinators.

### Classic Herb Garden Staples

| **Herb** | **Scent** | **Practical Tips** |
|----------|-----------|--------------------|
| **Lavender** | Heady violet aroma | Grow a mix of purple, pink, or white varieties for a scent that lasts through the warmer months |
| **Lemon Balm** | Fresh, subtly citrus with a hint of mint | Small white flowers attract bees |
| **Rosemary** | Wood, pine resin, earthy camphor | Spiky sprigs and delicate pink/purple/blue flowers thrive in sunny spots |

### The Mint Family  
From invigorating spearmint to spicy peppermint, these herbs are easy to grow and full of essential oils that perfume the air.

| **Mint Herb** | **Scent** | **Growing Notes** |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Thyme** | Savory, woody, warming | Plant in well‑drained, stony ground; sun intensifies aroma |
| **Oregano** | Rich, savoury, mixes pine, citrus, mint | Great for pizza and pasta, but also a fragrant companion plant |
| **Sweet Marjoram** | Mild, sweet, similar to oregano | Lilac or white flowers attract bees; low‑growing, ideal for edging and containers |
| **Sage** | Warming, full, slightly bitter | Coarse but soft leaves release scent when rubbed |
| **Basil** | Grassy, citrus, cloves, aniseed | Companion plant for tomatoes; strong aroma deters aphids |
| **Anise Hyssop** | Liquorice and mint blend | Grows up to 1.5 m high, 30 cm wide; dense indigo flowers |

## Enjoying the Fragrance to the Full

Fragrance spreads naturally on the breeze, but thoughtful placement maximises the experience.

- **Plant near walkways** – scents released as you brush past.
- **Use containers near doorways and windows** – let the aroma drift indoors on warm days.
- **Surround dining and seating areas** with a mix of soothingly fragrant plants for a relaxing atmosphere.
- **Position plants in sunny spots** (against walls, between patio paving) to release scented oils in the heat.

Colour and structure remain the foundations of a garden, but adding fragrance gives you an extra layer of pleasure. Happy sowing!
