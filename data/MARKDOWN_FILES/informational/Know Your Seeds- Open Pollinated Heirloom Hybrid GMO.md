# Know Your Seeds: Open‑Pollinated, Heirloom, Hybrid, GMO

## What’s in a Seed?

A seed is the **blueprint** that tells a plant how to grow.  
Traditionally, all seeds were *open‑pollinated*: pollen from a flower’s anther (the male part) lands on the stigma (the female part), fertilizes the ovary, and the seed forms—sometimes with fruit, sometimes without.

## Why Do We Care About Seed Types?

Over time we’ve selected plants for better flavor, color, hardiness, or yield. Different seed types help us capture and improve those traits. Below is a quick guide to the main categories and what they mean for your garden.

---

## Open‑Pollinated Seed

- **Definition**: Seeds produced by a plant’s own pollen (or from the same variety).  
- **Result**: Offspring are *true to type*—they look and behave like the parent plant.  
- **Heritage/Heirloom**: When you save seeds from one generation to the next, you’re preserving a *heritage* or *heirloom* line.  
- **Example**: The classic Grosse Lisse tomato is genetically identical to the Roma tomato; both were selected over time for specific traits (size, flavor, color, hardiness, etc.).  
- **Practical Tip**:  
  - *Save your own seeds* from the best plants.  
  - Store them in a cool, dry place and label by variety and harvest date.  
  - Plant them next season for a reliable crop that matches the parent.

> **Most of the seeds on this website are Open‑Pollinated. Many are also considered heirloom.**

## Hybrid Seed

- **Definition**: Seeds from a cross between two plants of the same species (or closely related species).  
- **Goal**: Combine desirable traits from both parents into one plant.  
- **Process**:  
  1. Cross‑pollinate two selected plants.  
  2. Grow the resulting seedlings.  
  3. Select the best performers and discard the rest.  
- **Example**: *Pink Lady* apples came from crossing *Golden Delicious* (sweet, early) with *Lady William* (firm, late‑ripening).  
- **F1 Hybrid**: The first‑generation hybrid that shows the best of both parents.  
  - **Analogy**: Like two unrelated humans (same species) having a child that inherits traits from both.  
  - **Seed Cost**: Higher because the cross must be repeated for each batch.  
  - **Seed Saving**: Seeds from an F1 hybrid will produce a mix of plants—most will be *inferior* to the original hybrid.  
  - **Home Garden Reality**: Saving F1 seeds is usually not worth the effort unless you’re willing to grow many seedlings, select the best, and re‑breed over several years.

> **Many seeds available as F1 hybrids offer the best features of both parents, but they’re more expensive and less reliable for seed saving.**

## GM (Genetically Modified) Seed

- **Definition**: Plants whose DNA has been engineered to add a new trait that doesn’t naturally exist.  
- **Common Traits**:  
  - Pest resistance (e.g., potato moth).  
  - Herbicide tolerance (e.g., glyphosate‑resistant canola).  
  - Reduced spoilage.  
- **Examples**:  
  - **Potato**: Gene from bacteria kills potato‑moth larvae.  
  - **Canola**: Herbicide‑resistant gene allows weed control with glyphosate.  
  - **Blue Rose**: Engineers are inserting a blue‑flower gene from another plant to create a true blue rose.  
- **Global Use**: Sweet corn, soybeans, cotton, potatoes, squash, canola, etc.  

> **None of the seeds on this website are GMO.**

## Quick Reference Cheat‑Sheet

| Seed Type | Key Feature | Seed‑Saving? | Typical Use |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Open‑Pollinated** | True‑to‑type | ✔️ | Home gardens, heirloom preservation |
| **Hybrid (F1)** | Best of both parents | ❌ (usually) | Commercial crops, high‑yield varieties |
| **GM** | Engineered trait | ❌ | Industrial agriculture, specialized traits |

## Take Action

1. **Identify** the seed type before you buy or plant.  
2. **Save** open‑pollinated seeds from your favorite plants.  
3. **Experiment** with hybrids if you want specific traits but be prepared to buy new seed each season.  
4. **Avoid** GM seeds if you prefer natural or heirloom varieties (and our catalog is free of GMOs).  

Happy planting!
