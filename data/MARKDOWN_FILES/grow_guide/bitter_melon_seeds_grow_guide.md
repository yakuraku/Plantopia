## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Bitter melon loves *full sun*. Pick a spot that receives **at least 6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a *well‑drained* mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, then dig or till to loosen the soil.  
  - Work in **aged animal manure or compost** to boost fertility.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.

## How to Sow Bitter Melon Seeds

### 1. Boost Germination  
- **Scarify** the seeds: gently nick the hard shell with a sharp knife or rub a small section off with fine sandpaper or a nail file.  
- *Alternatively*, soak the seeds for **12–24 hours** before sowing to soften the coat.  
- Read more about scarification [here](#).

### 2. Planting Directly in the Garden  
| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Depth** | Sow **15 mm** deep. |
| **Spacing** | **60 cm** between plants; rows **130–160 cm** apart. |
| **Moisture** | Keep soil **moist but never waterlogged**. |
| **Germination Time** | **10–15 days** at **25–32 °C** soil temperature. |
| **Protection** | Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

> **Tip:** Bitter melon is a *tender crop*—avoid transplanting or sowing until after the last frost.

## How to Grow Bitter Melon

### Watering  
- Check moisture **5 cm** below the surface (scratch a bit of soil with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the *early morning* or *late afternoon*.  
- **Avoid** wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- Learn more about watering [here](#).

### Fertilizing  
- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
- In poorer soils or for a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm** tall.  
  - **Liquid** fertilizer at the recommended rate/frequency during fruiting or flowering.

### Support & Spacing  
- **Ground Sprawl:** Allocate at least **2 m²** per plant.  
- **Trellis:** Vines will climb using tendrils; add extra support with twine or plant ties.  
- **Set up support** *before* sowing or transplanting to avoid disturbing roots later.

## How to Harvest Bitter Melon

- **Harvest Time:** Roughly **75 days** after sowing.  
- **Readiness:** Skin should be glossy; fruit should be large enough to eat.  
- **When to Pick:** Choose *tender and young* fruit—older ones can become unpalatable.  
- **Method:** Cut the fruit from the vine, leaving a small stem attached.  
- **Storage:** Keep in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.

## Common Problems When Growing Bitter Melon

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap/alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Not Setting Fruit** | Lack of pollination; flowers drop or tiny fruit shrivel. | Ensure both male and female flowers are present; hand‑pollinate with a paintbrush. |
| **Animals (Possums, Birds, etc.)** | Harvest destroyed overnight. | Use netting or cages; try a homemade spray of garlic, fish oil, or mustard. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; can reduce yield. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, and apply fungicide or a homemade spray. |
| **Sunscald** | White marks or blisters on fruit, often mounded. | Avoid pruning leaves during peak summer; cover plants with light fabric on very hot days. |

> **Pro Tip:** Regularly inspect your plants for early signs of these issues so you can act before they spread.
