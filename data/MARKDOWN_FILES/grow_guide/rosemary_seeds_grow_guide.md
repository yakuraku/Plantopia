# How to Grow Rosemary Seeds

**Family:** Lamiaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Salvia rosmarinus_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot** – Rosemary is a long‑lived plant, so pick a location where it can stay undisturbed.  
- **Full sun is a must** – Aim for **at least 6 h of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Well‑drained soil** – Rosemary hates soggy roots.  
  - No need for manure or heavy fertilisers; just **weed thoroughly** and **loosen the soil**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.  
- **Container growing** – If you’re using pots, pick a variety suited for containers.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of **≥ 20 L** for mature plants.  
  - Container plants may need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Rosemary Seeds

Rosemary seeds are easy to handle—no soaking or stratification required.

1. **Prepare the seedbed**  
   - Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sow**  
   - Drop seeds **3 mm deep**.  
3. **Moisture**  
   - Keep the soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
4. **Germination**  
   - Expect **15–25 days** at a soil temperature of **17–21 °C**.  
5. **Transplant**  
   - Move seedlings once they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing**  
   - When planting in the garden, space the plants **150 cm apart**.

> **Tip:** Rosemary can be slow to germinate. Stick to the depth and temperature guidelines and be patient for the best results.

## How to Grow Rosemary

- **Drought tolerance** – Once established, rosemary thrives in dry, well‑drained soil.  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings; test by scratching 10 cm below the surface.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.  
- **Fertilising** –  
  - **Balanced or fruit/veg fertiliser** can give a boost in poor soil.  
  - *Slow‑release*: apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - *Liquid*: apply during flowering or fruiting as recommended.  
- **Pruning** – After flowering, trim back to tidy the plant and stimulate new growth.  
  - Use sharp secateurs or snips and cut just above a set of lower leaves.

## How to Harvest Rosemary

- **Timing** – Harvest after **100–150 days** when stems are long enough to pick.  
- **Method** – Pinch off outer stems and leaves, leaving some on the plant for future growth.  
- **Storage**  
  - Short‑term: keep in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - Long‑term: dry or preserve in oil.

## Common Problems When Growing Rosemary

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Fix |
|---------|--------------------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose to dislodge them.<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage natural predators. |
| **Damping Off** | Seeds fail to germinate or seedlings rot, becoming soft and mushy at the base. | • Use fresh potting mix.<br>• Avoid watering foliage.<br>• Keep soil from becoming waterlogged. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread to cover leaves; can reduce yield. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves.<br>• Ensure good airflow.<br>• Remove affected leaves.<br>• Apply fungicide or a homemade spray if needed. |
| **Spider Mites** | Dry, wilted or discolored leaves; undersides feel sandpapery. | • Prune for better airflow.<br>• Spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulphur. |
