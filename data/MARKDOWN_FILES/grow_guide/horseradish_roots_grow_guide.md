# How to Grow Horseradish Roots  

**Family:** Brassicaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Armoracia rusticana_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Horseradish loves *full sun* – aim for at least **6 hours a day**.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Choose a *loose, well‑drained* bed enriched with organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, then dig to a *spade’s depth* (≈30 cm) to break up compact layers.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure** or **rich compost** to lighten heavy soils and boost fertility.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.  
- **Long‑term placement:** Horseradish can become invasive once established.  
  - Pick a *permanent spot* in a garden bed or grow in *large containers* (≥40 L) to keep it from spreading.  
- **Container tips:**  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Containers may need extra fertilizer during the growing season to support healthy growth.  

## How to Plant Horseradish  

1. **Trench:** Dig a shallow trench **3 cm deep** that matches the length of your root fragment.  
2. **Orientation:** Plant the root *horizontally*. If a shoot is present, position it *pointing up*.  
3. **Cover:** Fill the trench with soil, firming gently around the root.  
4. **Spacing:** Place each root **30 cm apart** to give space for expansion.  
5. **Water:** Water thoroughly after planting.  
6. **Moisture:** Keep the soil consistently moist until the first leaves emerge.  

## How to Grow Horseradish  

- **Watering:**  
  - Check the soil **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a small amount with your finger).  
  - Water *deeply* in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is well‑prepared, *no extra fertilizer* is needed.  
  - Over‑fertilizing can lead to lush foliage at the expense of root growth.  
  - In poor soils, use a *low‑nitrogen, high‑phosphorus* fertilizer (e.g., blood and bone) at the recommended rate.  

## How to Harvest Horseradish  

- **Timing:** Roots are ready in about **240 days**. For larger roots, leave them for **two or more seasons**.  
- **Season:** Harvest in **late autumn or early winter** after the leaves have died back.  
- **Method:**  
  - Use a garden fork to gently lift the entire plant.  
  - Shake off excess soil.  
  - Remove all small side roots if you want to prevent new plants from sprouting the next spring.  
- **Storage:**  
  - *Short‑term:* Place in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge or in damp sand in a cellar.  
  - *Long‑term:* Grate into vinegar or pickle for preservation.  

## Common Problems When Growing Horseradish  

Horseradish can face a few typical challenges. Below are the most common issues and quick fixes.  

### **Cabbage Moth & Cabbage White Butterfly**  
- **Signs:** White or grey wings with distinctive markings; caterpillars create large holes or skeletonize leaves.  
- **Prevention:**  
  - Use netting to exclude butterflies and moths.  
  - Deploy decoys to deter them.  
- **Control:**  
  - Hand‑pick caterpillars.  
  - Apply a selective spray only where needed.  

### **Forked Roots**  
- **Cause:** Stony or heavy clay soils that restrict root movement.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Cultivate the soil well before planting.  
  - Add coarse sand or compost to lighten the medium.  
  - Consider growing *round or short varieties* suited to heavy soils.  

### **Small Roots**  
- **Cause:** Over‑sowing or excessive fertilization.  
- **Fix:**  
  - Thin seedlings to give roots adequate space.  
  - Avoid fertilizing, as it encourages foliage over root development.  

### **Tough Roots**  
- **Indicator:** Roots were harvested too late.  
- **Advice:** Harvest when roots are still young and tender for the best texture.
