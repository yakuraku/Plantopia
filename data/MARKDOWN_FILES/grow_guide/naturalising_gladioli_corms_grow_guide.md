# How to Grow Naturalising Gladioli Corms

**Family:** Iridaceae  
**Binomial name:** *Gladiolus nanus*  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Aim for a **loose, well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, then dig to **spade depth** (≈30 cm) to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost**—this lightens heavy soils and feeds roots.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, choose a variety rated for container use.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a **minimum 10 L** pot.  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the season.

## How to Plant Naturalising Gladioli Corms

1. **Spacing & depth** – Plant each corm **10 cm apart** and **7 cm deep**, tip up.  
2. **Cover & water** – Fill in with soil and water well.  
3. **Moisture** – Keep the soil **moist but not soggy** until shoots appear.

## Growing the Gladioli

- **Watering:**  
  - Check the soil 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is already rich, skip extra fertilizer.  
  - In poorer soils or for a boost, use:  
    - *Liquid fertilizer* at the recommended rate when buds start to form.  
    - *Slow‑release fertilizer* in early spring.  
- **Flowering:** Expect blooms in **100–120 days**.  

## Deadheading & Cut Flowers

- **Deadhead** regularly: snip fading or dead flowers just above a set of leaves with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - This encourages more blooms.  
- **For cut flowers:**  
  - Cut the longest stems with sharp tools.  
  - Remove lower leaves and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.  

## Letting Gladioli Naturalise

- **Long‑term growth:**  
  - Gladioli can stay in the garden for years.  
  - If clumps become overcrowded, lift, store, and replant in autumn.  
- **Lifting corms:**  
  1. Wait until foliage turns yellow.  
  2. Cut foliage at ground level.  
  3. Use a garden fork to lift corms, handling gently.  
  4. Spread on a wire rack in a cool, dry spot for **10–14 days** to dry.  
  5. Store in a net bag until replanting in autumn.

## Common Problems & How to Handle Them

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting or discoloration; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; reduces yield. | Water at soil level (not on leaves), improve airflow, remove affected leaves, apply fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Rotten Corms** | Corms that look soft or have no roots/shoots; often from cold, wet soil or over‑soaking. | Don’t soak corms longer than recommended, plant in well‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers; lift and store over winter if grown perennially. |
| **Thrips** | Tiny black/beige/white flies (<1.5 mm) with larvae that leave tiny white or transparent marks on leaves and petals. | Wash with a garden hose, encourage predatory mites and lacewings, or spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that eat tender leaves at night, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use traps, or collect by torchlight. |
