# How to Grow Shallot from Seeds

**Family:** *Amaryllidaeae*  
**Binomial name:** _Allium cepa var. aggregatum_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Choose a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, dig over to loosen, then mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.  
- **Tip:** A healthy, loamy base means fewer problems later on.

## How to Sow Shallot Seeds

Shallot seeds are tiny but mighty—no pre‑treatment needed. You can plant them straight in the garden or start them indoors and transplant later.

### 1. Sow Directly in the Garden

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | **Plant** seeds **5 mm deep** and **5–10 cm apart** in rows **40 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep the soil **moist but not soggy**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–10 days** at **20–25 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raise Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist** soil—never let it dry out or become waterlogged. |
| 4 | Germinate in **7–10 days** at **20–25 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **5–10 cm apart** in rows **40 cm apart**. |

> **Optional trick:** Sow 3–5 seeds in a group, space groups **15 cm apart**, thin to **3 healthy seedlings** per group, and grow them together until harvest.

**Handling tiny seeds:**  
- Mix seeds with sand or fine potting mix before sowing.  
- Use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly.  
- Press lightly into the soil surface for good contact.  
- Keep them from drying out—extra care pays off.

## How to Grow Shallots

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil **5 cm below the surface**; water when it’s dry.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is well‑prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is needed.  
  - Over‑fertilizing can lead to lush leaves but weak roots.  
  - In poorer soil, use a **low‑nitrogen, high‑phosphorus** fertilizer (e.g., blood and bone) at the recommended rate.  
- **Thinning:**  
  - When seedlings are large enough to handle, pull out weak or small ones so plants are spaced **5–10 cm apart**.

## How to Harvest Shallots

- **Timing:** About **120 days** after sowing.  
- **Signs of readiness:**  
  - The neck between bulb and leaves becomes soft.  
  - Leaves start to fall over.  
- **Method:**  
  1. Use a fork to gently lift the plant, shaking off excess soil.  
  2. Harvest one plant first to confirm a bulb has formed.  
  3. If bulbs are small, leave the rest for another 2–3 weeks.  
- **Curing:**  
  - Place whole plants on wire racks or hang them in bunches.  
  - Keep in a **dry, cool place** for **2–3 weeks**.  
  - Bulbs with thick necks should be eaten soon; others can be stored.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Cut dried leaves **3–4 cm above** the bulb.  
  - Store in a cool, dry place for up to **6 months**.

## Common Problems & How to Fix Them

| Problem | What Happens | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small sap‑suckers (2–4 mm) on new shoots/undersides, causing wilting and honeydew that attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap/alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Bulbs Not Forming** | Early harvest, inconsistent watering, small planting material, or excess nitrogen. | Harvest after leaves die back, water consistently, use suitable varieties, avoid over‑fertilizing. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering due to extreme weather. | Wait until after frost danger or very hot periods; water deeply during heat. |
| **Rust (Puccinia sp.)** | Brown/orange raised spots on foliage, spread by wind/water, thrives at 10–20 °C with high humidity. | Space plants, provide full sun, avoid over‑fertilizing, remove dead material, rotate crops. |
| **Onion Thrips (Thrips tabaci)** | Tiny (≤1.5 mm) pale insects that leave silver patches, reduce yield. | Wash with a garden hose, mulch around plants, encourage predatory mites and lacewings, use companion planting. |

> **Pro tip:** Regularly inspect your plants for early signs of pests or disease—catching problems early saves the crop.
