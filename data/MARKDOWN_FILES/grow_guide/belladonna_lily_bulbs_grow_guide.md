# How to Grow Belladonna Lily Bulbs

**Family:** Amaryllidaceae  
**Binomial name:** *Amaryllis belladonna*  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Belladonna lilies thrive in **full sun** – aim for at least **6 hours of direct light** each day.  
- **Location:** As a perennial, give them a **permanent spot** where they won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Soil:** They need a **loose, well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed the area thoroughly.  
  - Dig to at least a **spade’s depth** to loosen the soil.  
  - Add **aged animal manure** or **compost** to lighten heavy soils and feed roots.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.

- **Containers:** Belladonna lilies can grow in pots.  
  - Choose a container **recommended for container growing**.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Ensure the pot is **at least 20 L** to accommodate mature plants.  
  - Remember that container plants may need **extra fertiliser** during the growing season.  

## How to Plant Belladonna Lily Bulbs

Plant directly in their final position—garden bed or container.

1. **Spacing:** Place bulbs **20–40 cm apart**.  
2. **Orientation:** Insert with the **tip pointing up** and **one‑third of the bulb above soil level**—this keeps the growing point dry and disease‑free.  
3. **Cover & Water:** Fill in soil and water thoroughly.  

## How to Grow Belladonna Lily

### Watering

- Check soil moisture **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
- Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilising

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertiliser because bulbs store energy for next year’s bloom.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑focused** fertiliser:  
  - **Slow‑release** at the recommended rate when shoots first appear, **or**  
  - **Liquid** at the recommended rate and frequency when shoots emerge.  
- After flowering, feed bulbs with **blood & bone**, aged or pelletised chicken manure, then water well.

### Blooming & Maintenance

- **Bloom time:** **120–180 days** after planting.  
- **Naturalised bulbs** (left in the ground for years) often produce **more flowers per stem** than newly planted ones.  
- **Deadhead** regularly:  
  - Use sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - Cut flowers with the longest stems for picking, or snap off dead blooms.  
  - Removing old flowers redirects energy back into the bulb, not seed production.  
- **Foliage:** Let leaves die down naturally after flowering; the bulb reabsorbs nutrients.  
  - Once all foliage has faded, trim individual leaves at ground level with sharp tools.  
- **Winter protection:** In cold climates, cover bulbs with **heavy mulch** to shield from frost.  
- **Summer protection:** Mulch heavily to guard against heat.  
- **Longevity:** Bulbs can stay in the ground for years—no need to lift and divide unless overcrowded or you want to relocate them.  

### Lifting & Storing Bulbs

1. **Lift** with a garden fork, being careful not to damage bulbs.  
2. **Prune** any dead leaves still attached.  
3. **Store** in a **cool, dry** area on a wire rack or a breathable netting bag.  
4. Ideal storage temperature: **~20 °C**; avoid heat above **30 °C**.  
5. Replant the following season following the planting chart above.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap/alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Mealybugs** (_Pseudococcidae_) | 3–6 mm, white/pink/gray cotton‑like coating; leaves wilt; honeydew attracts ants. | Wipe leaves, apply soap/alcohol spray, or encourage predators. *Read more about mealybugs here.* |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves/shoots, especially at night; leave slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, spot‑collect at night, or use traps. *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
