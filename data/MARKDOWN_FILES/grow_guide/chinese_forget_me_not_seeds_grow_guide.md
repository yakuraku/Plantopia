## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Full sun or part shade. Aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, dig to loosen, then mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a container‑friendly variety if you’re growing in pots.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - **Minimum size:** 10 L (about 2.5 gal).  
  - Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Chinese Forget‑Me‑Not Seeds

- **No pre‑treatment needed** (no soaking, stratification, etc.).  
- **Direct sow** in the garden for best results.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **8 mm deep** and **30 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but never soggy**. |
| 3 | Germination: **5–8 days** at **18–21 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather. |

**Tip:** If you prefer a quicker start, use the *scatter seed* method:  
- Roughen the soil surface.  
- Scatter seeds evenly.  
- Lightly smooth over to cover.

## Growing & Care

### Watering  
- Water when the soil feels **dry 5 cm below the surface** (test by finger).  
- **Deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering is best.  
- Avoid wetting the foliage to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilising  
- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra feed.  
- In poorer soils or for a boost:  
  - **High‑potassium or flowering‑plant fertilizer** works well.  
  - *Slow‑release*: apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - *Liquid*: apply during flowering/fruiting as recommended.

### Thinning  
- Once seedlings are sturdy, thin to **30 cm spacing**.  
- Pull out weak or small plants to give the rest room to grow.

### Flowering  
- Expect blooms in **75–85 days**.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading flowers just above a leaf set with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - This encourages more blooms.  
- For cut flowers: cut the longest stems, remove lower leaves, and place immediately in clean water.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Issue | What It Looks Like | How to Handle |
|-------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Tiny (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may leave honeydew attracting ants. | • Spray with a garden hose. <br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray. <br>• Invite predatory insects. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves. <br>• Remove and destroy affected leaves. <br>• Avoid overcrowding for airflow. <br>• If persistent, use a homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves. | • Water at soil level. <br>• Ensure good airflow. <br>• Remove affected leaves. <br>• Apply suitable fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves, leaving slimy trails. | • Remove hiding spots. <br>• Keep free‑range poultry. <br>• Use torchlight to spot at night or set traps. |
