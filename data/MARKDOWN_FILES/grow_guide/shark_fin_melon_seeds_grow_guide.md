## How to Sow Shark Fin Melon Seeds

Shark fin melon seeds are **easy to handle**—no soaking or stratification needed.

1. **Direct sow**:  
   - Plant **15 mm deep**.  
   - Space **100 cm apart** within a row, and **150 cm between rows**.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil consistently moist—never soggy or dry.  
3. **Germination:**  
   - Takes **7–14 days** at **22–28 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  
5. **Frost warning:** This tender crop is frost‑sensitive. **Never transplant or sow outdoors** until the danger of frost has passed.

## How to Grow Shark Fin Melon

### Watering

- Water when the top **5 cm** of soil feels dry (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
- **Deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering is best.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- For more watering tips, see [our watering guide](#).

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
- In poorer soils or for a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release fertilizer**: Apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm** tall.  
  - **Liquid fertilizer**: Use at the recommended rate/frequency during fruiting or flowering.

### Support & Spacing

- **Ground growth:** Allow **≥ 2 m² per plant**.  
- **Trellis:** Vines will climb using tendrils; add extra support with twine or plant ties.  
- **Large fruit:** Use a sling made from netting to support heavy melons.  
- **Set up support** *before* sowing or transplanting to avoid disturbing roots later.

### Mulching & Pruning

- **Mulch** under ripening fruit with straw or sugar cane to prevent rot.  
- Prune vines as needed to keep growth manageable.

### Winter Care

- In cold weather, the plant may die back.  
- **Cut back** to just above ground level in late autumn, or prune dead foliage when new leaves appear in spring.

## How to Harvest Shark Fin Melon

- **Harvest time:** Roughly **120 days** after sowing.  
- **Indicators of ripeness:**  
  - Stems become tough and woody.  
  - Leaves on the plant dry and brown.  
- **Method:** Cut the fruit from the vine, leaving **5–10 cm** of stem attached.  
- **Curing:**  
  - Let fruit cure for **one week** in a single layer, airy location, away from direct sun and frost.  
- **Storage:** Keep in a dark, dry space at **10–16 °C**.  
  - Rotate regularly and discard any fruit showing rot.

## Common Problems When Growing Shark Fin Melon

| Problem | Symptoms | Management |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Not setting fruit** | Lack of pollination; flowers drop or small fruit shrivels. | • Wait for both male and female flowers.<br>• Hand‑pollinate with a paintbrush. |
| **Animals (possums, birds, etc.)** | Harvest destroyed overnight. | • Use netting or cages.<br>• Spray with a homemade deterrent (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots spreading across leaves; can reduce yield. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves.<br>• Ensure good airflow.<br>• Remove affected leaves.<br>• Apply fungicide or homemade spray. |
