- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in **organic matter**.  
  - Start by **weeding** thoroughly, then **dig over** to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost** for a nutrient boost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, choose a variety labeled **“container‑friendly.”**  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of at least **40 L** to give the roots room to grow.  
  - Container plants often need a bit more **fertiliser** during the season to stay healthy.

## How to Sow Lovage Seeds

Lovage seeds are simple to handle—no soaking or stratification required.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | **Plant** seeds **6 mm** deep, spacing them **100 cm** apart. |
| 2 | Keep the soil **moist**—never soggy or dry. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–21 days** at a soil temperature of **20–25 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from **pests, pets, and harsh weather** until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **6 mm** deep. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist** soil, avoiding both wet and dry extremes. |
| 4 | Germinate in **7–21 days** at **20–25 °C**. |
| 5 | **Transplant** when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm** tall. |
| 6 | Space the plants **100 cm** apart in the garden. |

> **Tip:** For a quick start, try the *scatter seed* method—roughen the soil, sprinkle seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil.

## How to Grow Lovage

- **Watering:**  
  - Check the soil **5 cm** below the surface; water when it feels dry.  
  - Water **deeply** in the **early morning** or **late afternoon** to reduce evaporation.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  

- **Fertilising:**  
  - If the soil is well‑prepared, extra fertiliser isn’t usually needed.  
  - In poorer soils or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertiliser** at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid fertiliser** during fruiting or flowering, following the product’s recommended rate and frequency.  

- **Thinning:**  
  - When seedlings are large enough to handle, thin them to **100 cm** spacing by pulling out weaker ones.  

- **Harvesting Leaves vs. Seeds:**  
  - **Leaves:** Harvest regularly to encourage new growth. Pinch off outer leaves, leaving some on the plant.  
  - **Seeds:** Allow the plant to flower and set seed.  

- **Winter Care:**  
  - Lovage may die back in cold weather.  
  - In late autumn, cut plants back **just above ground level**.  
  - In spring, prune off any dead foliage when new leaves appear.

## How to Harvest Lovage

- **Timing:** Ready to harvest in about **90 days**.  
- **Leaves:**  
  - Harvest when leaves are large enough to eat.  
  - Pinch off outer leaves, leaving a few for future growth.  
- **Seeds:**  
  - When seed heads turn **brown**, collect the whole heads.  
  - Place them in a paper bag and hang **upside down** in a dry, airy spot until the seeds are fully dry.

## Common Problems When Growing Lovage

| Issue | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|-------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs nibble tender leaves at night, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, spot‑check with a torch at night, or set up traps. *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
