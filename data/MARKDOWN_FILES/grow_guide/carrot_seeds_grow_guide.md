# How to Grow Carrot Seeds

**Family:** Apiaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Daucus carota_  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial (but usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Carrots thrive in **full sun** – aim for at least **6 hours of direct light** each day.  
- **Soil:** They need a **loose, well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - **Weed** thoroughly and dig the soil to at least a spade’s depth to break up clods.  
  - Add **aged animal manure** or **compost** to lighten heavy soils and give roots room to grow.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting to reduce competition.  
  - *Tip:* A light layer of fine sand can help improve drainage in clay soils.

## How to Sow Carrot Seeds

Carrot seeds are tiny, so handle them with care:

1. **Direct sow**:  
   - Plant **5 mm deep** and **3–8 cm apart** within rows that are **25–30 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep the soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
3. **Germination:**  
   - Seeds sprout in **14–21 days** when the soil temperature is **10–30 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  

**Tip:** Mix seeds with a little sand or fine potting mix before sowing, or use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly. Press lightly into the surface to ensure good soil contact.

## How to Grow Carrots

- **Watering:**  
  - Check the soil 5 cm below the surface; water when it feels dry.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid leaf wetness, which can cause fungal diseases.  
- **Thinning (optional):**  
  - When seedlings are large enough to handle, pull out weak or small ones to give the remaining plants **3–8 cm spacing**.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is well‑prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is needed.  
  - Over‑fertilizing can lead to lush foliage at the expense of root growth.  
  - In poor soils, use a **low‑nitrogen, high‑phosphorus** fertilizer (e.g., blood and bone) at the recommended rate.

## How to Harvest Carrots

- **Timing:** Roots are ready in **70–140 days**.  
- **Method:**  
  - Gently pull at the base of the leaves or use a garden fork to lift multiple roots.  
  - Shake off excess soil and cut the foliage **1–2 cm above** the root.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - For longer term, carrots can be **frozen** or **pickled**.

## Common Problems When Growing Carrots

| Problem | What Happens | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insects swarm on leaf undersides, causing yellowing and wilting. | Rinse with a garden hose or spray with soap solution; attract beneficial insects. |
| **Carrot fly** (_Psila rosa_) | Eggs laid on seedlings; larvae burrow into roots. | Use companion plants or insect‑exclusion netting. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set, often after extreme weather. | Sow after frost danger; keep plants well‑watered during heat. |
| **Forked roots** | Roots split due to stony or heavy clay soil. | Cultivate soil before planting; add coarse sand or compost; choose round or short varieties for heavy soils. |
| **Split roots** | Caused by inconsistent watering. | Water deeply and evenly; consider recent rainfall before watering. |
| **Tough roots** | Harvested too late. | Pick when roots are still young and tender. |
| **Small roots** | Result from overcrowding or over‑fertilizing. | Thin seedlings; avoid excess fertilizer to prevent foliage overgrowth. |
