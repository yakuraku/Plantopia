## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Cornflowers thrive in *full sun* – pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of direct light** each day.  
- **Self‑seeding:** These plants often drop seeds at season’s end. If you *don’t* want them to take over, **deadhead** before seed set or grow them in containers.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs to be **well‑drained**; no extra manure or fertilizer is usually required.  
  - Thoroughly weed and loosen the soil before planting.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you sow.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a variety suited for pots.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a **minimum 20 L** pot.  
  - Container plants may need a little extra fertilizer during the season.

## How to Sow Cornflower Seeds

Cornflower seeds are *simple* to handle – no soaking or stratification needed. You can sow them straight into the garden or start seedlings in trays and transplant later.

### 1. Direct Sowing

1. **Depth & Spacing:** Sow 5 mm deep, 20–35 cm apart.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil **moist but never soggy or dry**.  
3. **Germination:** 7–14 days at 15–18 °C.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### 2. Raising Seedlings

1. **Containers:** Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or starter pellets.  
2. **Depth:** 5 mm deep.  
3. **Moisture:** Same rule – never wet or dry.  
4. **Germination:** 7–14 days at 15–18 °C.  
5. **Transplanting:** Move seedlings when they have their first true leaves and are 5–10 cm tall.  
6. **Spacing:** Plant out 20–35 cm apart.

> **Tip:** For a quick, informal approach, try the *scatter seed* method: roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover.

## How to Grow Cornflower

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water deeply in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to prevent fungal issues.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  
- **Fertilizer:** Cornflowers do well in *nutrient‑poor* soils; no extra feed is needed during the season.  
- **Thinning:** Once seedlings are big enough, pull out weak ones so plants stay 20–35 cm apart.  
- **Support:** Use stakes, bamboo canes, trellises, or string lines as needed. Install supports at sowing or transplanting to avoid root disturbance.  
- **Bloom Time:** Expect flowers in **70–80 days**.  
- **Deadheading:** Trim fading or dead blooms just above a leaf set with sharp secateurs or snips. Regular deadheading boosts flower production.

- **Cut Flowers:** For bouquets, cut the longest stems with sharp tools, remove lower leaves, and place immediately in clean water.

## Common Problems When Growing Cornflowers

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White, powdery spots that can spread across leaves; rarely fatal but reduces yield. | Water at soil level (not on leaves), improve airflow, remove affected leaves, and apply a suitable fungicide or homemade spray. *Read more about powdery mildew here.* |
