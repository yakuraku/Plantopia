# How to Grow Currants

**Family:** Grossulariaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Ribes sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

Currants are long‑lived perennials, so pick a **permanent spot** where they can grow without being disturbed by regular digging.  

- **Sunlight:** Full sun or part shade. Aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day, but protect the plants from scorching afternoon heat.  
- **Soil:** Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  1. Weed the area thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  3. Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  4. Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:** If you’re growing currants in pots, choose a variety labeled **“container‑friendly.”**  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Minimum pot size: **20 L** for mature plants.  
  - Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Plant Currants

Plant the canes **right after delivery** and keep the roots moist.

1. **Remove** the cane from its bag and shake off the coir.  
2. **Soak** the roots in water for **1–2 h** (no longer than 2 h to avoid rot).  
   - Optional: Add seaweed solution at the recommended rate.  
3. **Spacing:** 120–150 cm between canes.  
4. **Dig** a hole **30 cm deep** and create a small mound in the centre.  
5. **Place** the cane on the mound, spreading the roots evenly.  
6. **Backfill** with soil, ensuring the bottom of the stem is level with the soil surface.  
7. **Water** thoroughly after planting.

## How to Grow Currants

Currants need a sturdy support system.  
- **Trellis or strong posts** work best.  
- **Tie** the cane gently with twine or plant ties as soon as you plant it—this prevents root disturbance later.  
- The plants have an upright habit and form a small bush, but a trellis helps keep fruit off the ground and improves airflow.

### Watering

- Water when the soil is dry **≈ 5 cm** below the surface (check by scratching a bit of soil).  
- **Deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering is ideal.  
- **Avoid** wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising

- If the soil is already well‑prepared, no extra fertiliser is needed.  
- In poorer soils or for a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
  - **Liquid** fertilizer at the recommended rate and frequency during fruiting or flowering.

## How to Prune Currants

Currants fruit on **1–3 year‑old wood**, so pruning strategy changes as the plant matures.

### Initial Pruning & Training

Aim for an **open vase shape** with **8–10 main branches** emerging from the central stem. Cut just above an outward or upward‑facing bud.

| Year | Action |
|------|--------|
| **1st year** | Select 3–5 of the strongest shoots; cut them back by **half**. Remove all other shoots and any that grow from the short stem. |
| **2nd year** | Build the framework: choose 6–8 strong, outward‑facing shoots; cut back by **¼**. Remove crossing or inward‑growing shoots. Trim remaining shoots to **3–4 buds** and keep the stem clear. |

### Established Plants

An open shape allows more light and airflow, reducing disease risk.

- **Winter pruning** (late winter/early spring):  
  - Remove dead or damaged shoots.  
  - On mature plants, cut **1–3** less productive branches each year or every other year to stimulate new growth.  
  - Remove any shoots from the main stem or those touching the ground.  
  - **Spur‑prune** side shoots for larger, fewer fruits: prune last year’s growth on main branches to **3–4 buds**; on side shoots to **2 buds**.  
- **Summer pruning** (mid‑December to January):  
  - Cut back current‑season side shoots from main branches to about **five leaves**.  
  - Avoid pruning shoots needed to replace older branches.

## How to Harvest Currants

- Harvest when the berries turn **white**.  
- Gently pull them off the plant.  
- Ripe currants are best eaten soon after harvest.  
- For short‑term storage, keep them in a container in the fridge.  
- Use them in drinks, syrups, preserves, jams, jellies, and pies.

## Common Problems When Growing Currants

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Grey mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Mouldy flowers, rotting fruit; spores spread by wind. | Prune affected parts. Water at soil level (not on leaves). Apply fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Animals (possums, birds, etc.)** | Large harvest loss overnight. | Use netting or cages. Try homemade sprays (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia_ sp.) | Brown/orange raised spots or patches on leaves. | Space plants to avoid overcrowding. Provide full sun. Avoid over‑fertilising. Remove dead plants and practice crop rotation. |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots that spread to cover leaves. | Water at soil level. Ensure good airflow. Remove affected leaves. Use fungicide or homemade spray if necessary. |
| **Yellowing leaves** | Nutrient deficiency sign. | Apply nitrogen‑rich or leafy‑green fertilizer at recommended rate. Liquid or foliar fertiliser works fast. Water deeply after fertilising and avoid heat or water stress. |
