# How to Grow Herbaceous Peonies

## Preparation

- **Perennial nature** – Peonies live for many years, so choose a permanent spot where they won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Climate** – They thrive in cool to temperate zones and need a *cold winter* to set buds and flower beautifully.  
- **Sun & soil** – Pick a sunny location with **rich, well‑drained** soil.  
- **Soil pH** – Peonies prefer an **alkaline** (pH > 7) environment.  
  - If your soil is below 7, apply **dolomite** (calcium‑magnesium carbonate) or **garden lime** (calcium carbonate) in powder or liquid form at the recommended rate.  
  - Water well before planting to raise the pH and make nutrients more available.

## How to Plant Herbaceous Peonies

1. **Dig a generous, shallow hole** and firm the base.  
2. **Spread the smaller roots** out and position the tuberous root with buds or “eyes” facing **upwards**.  
3. **Depth** – Keep the buds **2.5–3 cm below the soil surface**; avoid planting too deep, or the flowers will suffer.  
4. **Backfill** with soil, taking care not to push the root any deeper.  
5. **Water thoroughly** after planting.  
6. **Mulch caution** – Do **not mulch close to the crown**; a blanket of mulch can keep the plant too warm and harbor disease.  
7. **Spacing** – Allow at least **60 cm** between plants to give them room to grow.

## How to Grow

- **Neutral soil** – Regular lime applications keep the soil in the peony’s preferred pH range.  
- **Timing** – Spread lime **toward the end of flowering** to aid root development and next‑year blooms.  
- **Wind protection** – Provide shelter from strong winds and stake plants if needed to support large flowers.  
- **Air circulation** – Good airflow helps prevent disease; avoid placing mulch over the crown.  
- **Autumn care** – When foliage turns color and dies back, cut the whole bush **just above the ground**.  
  - *Top‑dress* the soil with compost or a complete fertilizer and lime, but **do not cover the crown**.  
  - Fertilize again in **early spring**.  
- **Flowering timeline** –  
  - 1st season: unlikely to flower.  
  - 2nd season: may produce a few blooms.  
  - 3rd season onward: expect a spectacular display.  
- **Cut flowers** – Pick when buds are soft enough to be squashed gently.  
  - Cut stems, leaving **two sets of leaves** on the plant to keep it healthy.

## Common Problems When Growing

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Prevention & Treatment |
|---------|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Grey mould** (*Botrytis* sp.) | Flowers become mouldy; fruit rots. Spores spread by wind, survive in soil or green waste. | • Prune affected flowers and fruit.<br>• Water at soil level (avoid wetting leaves).<br>• Apply an appropriate fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots on leaves that can cover the entire surface. | • Water at soil level.<br>• Ensure good airflow between plants.<br>• Remove affected leaves.<br>• Spray with an appropriate fungicide or homemade spray if necessary. |
