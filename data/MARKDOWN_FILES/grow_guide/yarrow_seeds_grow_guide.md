# How to Grow Yarrow Seeds

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Achillea sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

---

## Preparation

- **Sun & Shade** – Yarrow loves **full sun** or **partial shade**. Aim for at least **3 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Permanent Spot** – As a perennial, yarrow thrives when left undisturbed. Pick a **fixed location** where you won’t dig up the soil every year.  
- **Self‑seeding** – Yarrow will drop seeds at season’s end, often sprouting the next year. If you want to keep it in a specific spot, **deadhead** before seed drop or grow in containers.  
- **Soil** – Needs **well‑drained, organic‑rich soil**.  
  1. Weed thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  3. Mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  4. Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

- **Container Growing** – If you’re using pots, choose a variety suited for containers.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Pick a pot **≥10 L** for mature plants.  
  - Containers may need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Yarrow Seeds

Yarrow seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification required.

### Step‑by‑Step

1. **Fill** trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** (or use soil starter pellets).  
2. **Sow** seeds **2 mm deep**.  
3. **Moisture** – Keep the soil damp, but never waterlogged.  
4. **Germination** – Expect **10–14 days** at **18–22 °C**.  
5. **Transplant** when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing** – When planting outdoors, space yarrow **60 cm apart**.

> **Tip:** Yarrow seeds are tiny and can drift away.  
> • Mix them with a little sand or fine potting mix before sowing.  
> • Use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly.  
> • Press lightly into the soil surface to improve seed‑soil contact.  
> • Keep seeds and seedlings from drying out.

## How to Grow Yarrow

### Watering

- Water when the soil feels **dry 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil).  
- Aim for **deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal risk.  
- *Learn more about watering here.*

### Fertilising

- If the soil is already rich, **no extra fertiliser** is needed.  
- For poorer soil or a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release** fertilizer (high‑potassium or flowering‑plant formula) at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - **Liquid** fertilizer during flowering or fruiting, following the product’s recommended rate and frequency.  

### Flowering & Maintenance

- Yarrow typically **blooms in 130–150 days**.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: use sharp secateurs or snips to cut faded flowers just above a leaf set.  
  - This encourages more blooms.  
  - *Learn more about deadheading flowering plants here.*  
- After flowering, **prune** to tidy the plant and stimulate new growth.  
  - Cut stems just above lower leaves.  
- In cold weather, yarrow may die back.  
  - **Cut back** to ground level in late autumn, or prune dead foliage when new leaves appear in spring.

## Common Problems When Growing Yarrow

| Issue | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|-------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose to dislodge them. <br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray. <br>• Invite predatory insects. <br>*Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Grey Mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Mouldy flowers and rotting fruit; spores spread by wind, survive in soil or green waste. | • Prune affected flowers/fruit. <br>• Water at soil level, not on leaves. <br>• Apply suitable fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that expand to cover leaves; reduces yield but rarely fatal. | • Water at soil level, avoid leaf wetting. <br>• Ensure good airflow between plants. <br>• Remove affected leaves. <br>• Use fungicide or homemade spray if needed. <br>*Read more about powdery mildew here.* |
