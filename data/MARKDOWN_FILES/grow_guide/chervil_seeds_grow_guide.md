# How to Grow Chervil Seeds  

**Family:** *Apiaceae*  
**Binomial name:** _Anthriscus cerefolium_  
**Life Cycle:** *Biennial*  

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Chervil thrives in full sun, partial shade, or even a bit of shade.  
- **Soil:** Use a well‑drained mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area.  
  - Loosen the soil by digging or turning.  
  - Mix in aged animal manure or compost.  
- **Weed Control:** Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Container Growing:**  
  - Choose a variety suited for pots.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - **Minimum pot size:** 10 L (about 2.5 gal).  
  - Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the season.  

## How to Sow Chervil Seeds  

Chervil seeds need no pre‑treatment (no soaking or stratification).  
You can sow them directly in the garden or raise seedlings first.

### Sow Direct  

1. **Depth & Spacing:** Plant 6 mm deep, 30 cm apart.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil *moist*—never soggy or dry.  
3. **Germination:** 10–14 days at 13–20 °C.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather.  

### Raise Seedlings  

1. **Containers:** Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sowing:** 6 mm deep.  
3. **Moisture:** Same rule—never wet or dry.  
4. **Germination:** 10–14 days at 13–20 °C.  
5. **Transplanting:** Move seedlings when they have their first true leaves and are 5–10 cm tall.  
6. **Spacing:** Plant out 30 cm apart.  

> **Tip:** Chervil also works well with the *scatter seed* method—roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil.

> **Note:** Avoid sowing or transplanting in very hot weather; chervil is a cool‑season crop and will bolt.

## How to Grow Chervil  

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface; water when it feels dry.  
  - Water *deeply* in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  

- **Fertilising:**  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra fertiliser.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - *Slow‑release* fertilizer at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - *Liquid* fertilizer during the growing season, following label rates.  

- **Thinning:** When seedlings are large enough, pull out weak ones so plants are ~30 cm apart.  

- **Flower Stalks:** Remove them immediately to keep the plant vegetative and extend harvest time.  

## How to Harvest Chervil  

- **Timing:** Ready in ~60–70 days.  
- **Method:** Pinch off outer leaves, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
- **Use:** Consume fresh as soon as possible.  
- **Storage:** Keep in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge for short‑term use.  

## Common Problems When Growing Chervil  

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Prevention / Fix |
|---------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set, often after a heat spike. | Sow after the last frost and avoid hot weather. Keep plants well‑watered and shaded during heat waves. |
| **Carrot Fly (Psila rosa)** | Eggs laid on seedlings; larvae burrow into roots. | Use companion plants or insect‑exclusion netting. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Night‑time leaf damage, slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep poultry, use traps or torchlight collection. |
| **Whitefly** | Yellowing or wilting leaves, especially underside. | Rinse with a garden hose or spray with soapy water. Badly affected plants may need removal. Encourage beneficial predators. |
