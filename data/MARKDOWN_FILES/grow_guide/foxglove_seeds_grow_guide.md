# How to Grow Foxglove Seeds

**Family:** Plantaginaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Digitalis purpurea_  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial

## Preparation

Foxglove plants often *self‑seed* in the garden. Seeds fall onto the soil at the end of the season and may germinate the next year.  
- **Choose a welcoming spot**: If you want foxgloves to thrive, pick a sunny area.  
- **Control unwanted spread**: Deadhead plants before they set seed, or grow them in containers.

**Sunlight**  
- Full sun or part shade is ideal.  
- Aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.

**Soil**  
- Needs to be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
- Weeding, loosening, and adding aged animal manure or compost will give your plants a solid start.  
- Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

**Container Growing**  
- Use a variety suited to pots.  
- A **minimum of 20 L** pot is recommended for mature foxgloves.  
- Container plants may need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Foxglove Seeds

Foxglove seeds are tiny but **don’t need any pre‑treatment** (soaking, stratification, etc.).  
- Light exposure can boost germination, so press seeds onto damp soil and lightly cover with fine soil.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **0 mm deep** and **30–40 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but not waterlogged**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **14–21 days** at **18–21 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **0 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain moist soil (never wet or dry). |
| 4 | Germination: **14–21 days** at **18–21 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **30–40 cm apart** when planting out. |

**Scatter‑Seed Method**  
- Roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly smooth over.  
- Great for quick, even coverage.

**Tips for Tiny Seeds**  
- Handle with care to avoid wind or water loss.  
- Mix seeds with sand or fine potting mix before sowing, or use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them.  
- Press lightly into the surface to ensure good soil contact.  
- Keep seeds and seedlings from drying out.

## How to Grow Foxglove

### Watering  
- Water when the soil is dry **≈ 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil).  
- **Deep watering** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising  
- Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra fertiliser.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertiliser.

| Timing | Method | Recommendation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Transplanting / 5–10 cm tall seedlings | Slow‑release | Apply at the recommended rate. |
| Flowering / fruiting | Liquid | Apply at the recommended rate and frequency. |

### Support  
- Foxgloves can grow tall; use a **stake, bamboo cane, trellis, or string lines**.  
- Install support **before sowing or transplanting** to avoid disturbing roots later.

### Flowering Time  
- Expect first blooms in **130–150 days**.

### Deadheading  
- Regularly remove fading or dead flowers **just above a set of leaves** using sharp secateurs or snips.  
- Encourages more blooms.

### Pruning  
- After flowering, trim back to tidy the plant and stimulate strong new growth.  
- Cut stems just above a lower leaf set with sharp tools.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; can reduce yield. | Water at soil level (not on leaves), improve air flow, remove affected leaves, and apply a suitable fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Tender leaves and shoots eaten, especially at night; slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use torchlight to spot them, or set traps. |
