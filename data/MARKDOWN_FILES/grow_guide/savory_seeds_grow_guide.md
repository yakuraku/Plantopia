# How to Grow Savory Seeds

**Family:** Lamiaceae  
**Binomial name:** *Satureja sp.*  
**Life Cycle:** Annual or Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Savory loves *full sun*—pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Perennials:** If you’re growing a perennial variety, plant it in a *permanent location* so it won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a *well‑drained* mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, loosen the soil, and add **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
  - For more on soil prep, see the linked guide.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a variety suited to container growing.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot that’s **at least 10 L** in volume.  
  - Container plants often need extra fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Savory Seeds

Savory seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking or stratification needed. You can sow them directly in the garden or start them indoors and transplant later.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **3 mm deep** and **30–40 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep the soil **moist but not waterlogged**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–14 days** at **20–22 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **3 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain moist soil (never soggy or dry). |
| 4 | Germinate in **7–14 days** at **20–22 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **30–40 cm apart** in the garden. |

> **Tip for cool climates:** Start seeds indoors **6 weeks** before the last expected frost. Keep them in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Savory

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil is dry **≈ 5 cm** below the surface (check by feeling the soil).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - More on watering: see the linked resource.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, you usually don’t need extra fertilizer.  
  - In poorer soil or to give a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertilizer** at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid fertilizer** during fruiting or flowering, following the product’s recommended rate and frequency.  
- **Pruning:**  
  - After flowering, trim back to tidy the plant and stimulate new growth.  
  - Use sharp secateurs or snips and cut stems just above a set of lower leaves.

## How to Harvest Savory

- **Timing:** Harvest is ready in **60–70 days**.  
- **Method:** Pinch off outer stems and leaves, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Short‑term: place stems in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - Long‑term: dry the stems for later use.

## Common Problems When Growing Savory

| Problem | Description | Management |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects that cluster on new shoots or leaf undersides. They can cause wilting, discoloration, and produce honeydew that attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose to dislodge them.<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage natural predators (ladybugs, lacewings). |
| **Root Rot** | Fungal disease from wet soil. Symptoms: slow establishment, yellowing or wilted foliage, soft brown tissue at stem base and roots. Often fatal. | • Remove and discard affected plants.<br>• Reduce soil moisture.<br>• Add organic matter.<br>• Ensure mulch doesn’t touch stems. |
