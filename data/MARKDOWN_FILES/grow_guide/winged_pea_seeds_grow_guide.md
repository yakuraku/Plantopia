## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Winged peas thrive in *full sun*. Pick a spot that receives **at least 6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a *well‑drained* mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, then dig the soil to loosen it.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost** to boost fertility.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.

## How to Sow Winged Pea Seeds

Winged pea seeds are *straightforward*—no soaking or stratification needed.

1. **Direct sow**:  
   - Plant seeds **20 mm deep** and **20 cm apart** within a row.  
   - Space rows **100 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep the soil *moist but never waterlogged*.  
3. **Germination:**  
   - Seeds sprout in **7–21 days** when the soil temperature is **15–20 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  
5. **Frost caution:** Winged peas are frost‑sensitive. **Do not transplant or sow** until the danger of frost has passed.

## How to Grow Winged Pea

### Watering

- Water when the soil feels dry **about 5 cm below the surface** (check by gently scratching the soil).  
- Aim for **deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering.  
- **Avoid wetting the foliage** to reduce fungal risk.  
- *Learn more about watering here.*

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
- If soil is poor or you want a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release fertilizer**: apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm tall**.  
  - **Liquid fertilizer**: apply at the recommended rate/frequency during flowering or fruiting.

### Training & Support

- Winged peas *sprawl* along the ground.  
- **Lift** them off the soil using twigs or bamboo canes to create a low trellis.  
  - Benefits: keeps plants out of reach of slugs/snails, improves airflow, and eases harvesting.

## How to Harvest Winged Peas

- **Harvest window:** **60–80 days** after sowing.  
- **Pod size:** Pick when pods are **3–5 cm long**.  
- **Method:** Cut pods with snips or secateurs.  
- **Frequency:** Harvest regularly to encourage more pods.  
- **Short‑term storage:** Keep cut pods in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
- **For dried beans:**  
  1. Leave pods on the plant until fully dry.  
  2. Cut with sharp snips.  
  3. Dry thoroughly, then remove seeds.  
  4. Store seeds in an airtight container.  
  5. Use dried beans in stews, soups, or roast/ground as a coffee substitute.

## Common Problems When Growing Winged Peas

| Issue | Symptoms | Management |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Tough Pods** | Pods become hard if harvested too late. | Harvest when pods are firm yet still tender; early, smaller pods encourage more production. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scabs; premature leaf/flower drop. | Water at soil level, discard fallen leaves/fruit, practice crop rotation. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level, remove/destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding, consider homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Frost Damage** | Leaves wilt, turn black. | Wait for frost danger to pass before planting; harvest before winter; prune damaged leaves. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves. | Water at soil level, ensure good airflow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide or homemade spray. *Read more about powdery mildew here.* |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Nighttime feeders leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, use torchlight traps, or set traps. *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
