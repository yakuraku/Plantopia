**Family:** Fabaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Lathyrus odoratus_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Sweetpeas thrive in *full sun* or *partial shade*. Aim for at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Weigh out the area, remove weeds, dig over, and mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **pH (Optional):** Sweetpeas prefer an **alkaline** soil.  
  - If your soil pH is below 7, add **dolomite** (calcium‑magnesium carbonate) or **garden lime** (calcium carbonate) at the recommended rate.  
  - Water thoroughly before planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a variety suited for container growth.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot of at least **40 L**.  
  - Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the season.

## How to Sow Sweetpea Seeds

> *Optional:* Soaking or scarifying seeds can speed germination.

- **Soaking:** Place seeds in room‑temperature water for **24 h**; they should swell noticeably.  
- **Scarifying:** Use a sharp knife to nick each seed’s shell, or gently file away a section of the husk with fine sandpaper or a nail file.  

**Direct Sowing (Garden):**

1. **Depth & Spacing:** Sow 25 mm deep, 15 cm apart.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil consistently moist—never waterlogged or dry.  
3. **Germination:** Expect 14–21 days at a soil temperature of **13–18 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

## Growing Sweetpeas

### Watering

- Water when the top **5 cm** of soil feels dry (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- **Best times:** Early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid leaf wetting** to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertiliser.  
- **Boosting growth:**  
  - *Slow‑release* fertiliser at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - *Liquid* fertiliser during fruiting or flowering, following the label’s rate and frequency.

### Support

- Sweetpeas need a **trellis** or sturdy support.  
- Tie gently with twine or plant ties; set up support *before* sowing or transplanting to avoid root disturbance.  
- Dwarf varieties are often self‑supporting; a trellis is optional.

### Pinching

- Pinch out the top growth to encourage denser, stronger stems and more flowers.  
- Use sharp secateurs or snips to remove the upper set of leaves, cutting just above a lower leaf pair.

### Flowering

- Sweetpeas typically flower in **80–100 days**.  
- **Cut flowers:** Trim the longest stems with sharp snips, remove lower leaves, and place immediately in clean water.  
- **Deadheading:** Regularly cut fading or dead flowers just above a leaf set to promote further blooming.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Damping Off** | Seeds fail to germinate or seedlings rot at the base, becoming soft and mushy. | Use fresh potting mix, avoid overwatering, keep foliage dry, and ensure good drainage. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches on leaves, especially undersides. | Water at soil level only, remove and destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding, consider a homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves, leaving slimy trails, mainly at night. | Remove hiding spots, use free‑range poultry, collect by torchlight, or set traps. |
