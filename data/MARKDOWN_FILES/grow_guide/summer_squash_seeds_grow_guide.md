# How to Grow Summer Squash Seeds

**Family:** Cucurbitaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Cucurbita sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Summer squash loves *full sun* – pick a spot that gets at least **6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Soil:** Use a *well‑drained* mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area.  
  - Dig or till to loosen the soil.  
  - Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.

### Bush varieties only  
- These plants can thrive in containers.  
- Choose a container‑friendly variety.  
- Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot that holds **at least 40 L**.  
- Container plants often need extra fertilizer during the growing season.  

## How to Sow Summer Squash Seeds

You can **direct‑sow** in the garden or raise seedlings in trays and transplant later.

### Sow Direct

1. Plant seeds **15 mm** deep, **60–80 cm** apart.  
2. Space rows **90–100 cm** apart.  
3. Keep the soil **moist but not waterlogged**.  
4. Germination takes **7–10 days** at a soil temperature of **21–35 °C**.  
5. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  

### Raise Seedlings

1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. Sow seeds **15 mm** deep.  
3. Maintain soil moisture (never wet or dry).  
4. Germination: **7–10 days** at **21–35 °C**.  
5. Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm** tall.  
6. Plant out, spacing **60–80 cm** apart, rows **90–100 cm** apart.  

> **Tip:** Summer squash is frost‑sensitive. **Never sow or transplant** until the danger of frost has passed.  

## How to Grow Summer Squash

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil feels dry about **5 cm** below the surface (check by gently scratching the soil).  
  - Water deeply in the **early morning** or **late afternoon**.  
  - **Avoid wetting the leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, no extra fertilizer is needed.  
  - For poorer soil or a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertilizer** – apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid fertilizer** – apply at the recommended rate and frequency while plants are fruiting or flowering.  

### Vine pumpkins only  
- Vines can **sprawl on the ground** or climb a sturdy trellis.  
- Ground‑grown vines need **at least 2 m²** per plant.  
- Trellis‑grown vines attach via tendrils; extra support can be added with twine or plant ties.  
- Large fruit may need a sling made from netting.  
- **Set up support before sowing or transplanting** to avoid disturbing roots later.  

## How to Harvest Summer Squash

- **Harvest window:** **50–100 days** after sowing.  
- **When ready:** The skin should be glossy, and the fruit should be large enough to eat.  
- **Harvest method:** Cut the fruit from the vine or bush, leaving a small stem attached.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Short‑term: Keep in the fridge.  
  - Long‑term: Freeze, can, or pickle.  

### Vine varieties only  
- Fruit can stay on the vine until it’s large.  
- Store and use it similarly to pumpkin.  

## Common Problems When Growing Summer Squash

| Problem | What to Watch For | Quick Fix | Read More |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. | *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Blossom End Rot** | Dark, hard discoloration from the bottom up; caused by calcium deficiency and inconsistent watering. | Dispose of affected fruit, water regularly and evenly, correct soil pH and nutrients. | *Read more about blossom end rot here.* |
| **Not Setting Fruit** | Flowers fall off or tiny fruit shrivels and rots; often due to poor pollination. | Wait for both male and female flowers; hand‑pollinate with a paintbrush. | *Read more about hand pollination here.* |
| **Animals (possums, birds, etc.)** | Sudden loss of harvest. | Use netting or cages; try homemade sprays (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |  |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; reduces yield but rarely fatal. | Water at soil level (not on leaves), improve airflow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide or homemade spray if needed. | *Read more about powdery mildew here.* |
