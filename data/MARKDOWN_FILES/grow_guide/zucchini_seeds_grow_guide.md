# How to Grow Zucchini Seeds

**Family:** *Curcurbit*  
**Binomial name:** _Cucurbita pepo_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Zucchini loves *full sun*. Pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly **weed** the area, then **dig over** to loosen the soil.  
  - Work in **aged animal manure** or **compost** to boost fertility.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.

## How to Sow Zucchini Seeds

Zucchini seeds are simple to handle—no soaking or stratification needed.  
**Direct sowing** is the best approach.

1. **Planting depth & spacing**  
   - Sow seeds **20 mm deep**.  
   - Space seeds **50–80 cm apart** within rows.  
   - Keep rows **80–120 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture**  
   - Maintain soil that is **moist but never waterlogged**.  
3. **Germination**  
   - Seeds should sprout in **7–14 days** when the soil temperature is **21–35 °C**.  
4. **Protection**  
   - Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  

> **Tip:** Zucchini is frost‑sensitive. **Never transplant or sow outdoors** until the danger of frost has passed.  
> **Optional:** In cooler climates, start seeds indoors **6 weeks before the last expected frost**. Grow them in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Zucchini

- **Watering**  
  - Check soil moisture **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - **Avoid wetting the leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.

- **Fertilizing**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is usually needed.  
  - For poorer soils or a nutrient boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertilizer**: apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm tall**.  
    - **Liquid fertilizer**: apply at the recommended rate and frequency during fruiting or flowering.

## How to Harvest Zucchini

- **Readiness:** Harvest when the skin is **glossy** and the fruit is **tender and young**—older fruit can become tough and less tasty.  
- **Method:** Cut the fruit from the vine or bush, leaving a small stem attached.  
- **Storage:**  
  - **Short term:** Keep in the fridge.  
  - **Long term:** Freeze, can, or pickle.

## Common Problems When Growing Zucchini

| Problem | What to Watch For | Quick Fix |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Blossom End Rot** | Dark, hard discoloration starting at the bottom of the fruit. | *Consistent watering*, correct soil pH, and balanced nutrients. Dispose of affected fruit. |
| **Not Setting Fruit** | Flowers fall off or tiny fruit shrivel and rot. | Ensure both male and female flowers are present. Use a paintbrush to transfer pollen. |
| **Animals (possums, birds, etc.)** | Large harvest loss overnight. | Use **netting or cages**; try homemade sprays (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, and apply fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
