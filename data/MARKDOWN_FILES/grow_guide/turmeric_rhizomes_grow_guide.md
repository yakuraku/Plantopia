**Binomial name:** _Curcuma longa_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial

## Preparation

Turmeric loves **full sun to part shade**.  
- Aim for **at least 3 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- A spot that gets **morning sun and afternoon shade** works best.

### Soil

- Choose a **well‑drained** bed rich in organic matter.  
- Thoroughly **weed** the area, then **dig over** to loosen the soil.  
- Mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost** for extra nutrients.  
- Keep the spot weed‑free until you plant.

> *Tip:* For temperate or cold climates, grow turmeric in **containers**.  
> Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot that holds at least **40 L**.  
> Container plants often need a little extra fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Plant Turmeric Rhizomes

Turmeric starts from **rhizomes**—swollen, horizontal stems that grow just below the soil surface. Shoots emerge from “eyes” on the rhizomes.

- **Temperature:** Soil should be **20–30 °C** for optimal shoot growth.  
- **Planting depth:** 5 cm deep, **eyes facing up**.  
- **Spacing:** 15 cm apart.  
- **Moisture:** Keep soil **just moist**—not wet—until shoots appear.

## Growing Turmeric

### Watering

- **Regular, even moisture** is key; never let the soil dry out.  
- Water **deeply** in the **early morning** or **late afternoon**.  
- **Avoid wetting the leaves** to reduce fungal risk.  
- As the plant **dies back**, reduce watering to encourage rhizome thickening.

### Fertilizing

- If the soil is already well‑prepared, you may skip extra fertilizer.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **balanced or vegetable‑specific fertilizer**:

  * **Slow‑release**: Apply at the recommended rate when shoots reach **5–10 cm**.  
  * **Liquid**: Follow the label for spring and summer applications.

### Seasonal Care

- In cold climates, turmeric may **die back** in autumn/winter.  
  - When leaves yellow, **harvest** or cut back just above ground.  
  - Alternatively, **move pots indoors** or into a greenhouse.  
- If rhizomes become crowded, **lift** them in spring, split into smaller pieces, and replant.

## Harvesting Turmeric

- **Harvest window:** **160–190 days** after planting.  
- **Ready rhizomes** are large enough to eat; harvest as needed or all at once.  
- **Method:** Gently dig, shake off soil, and cut stems **1–2 cm** above the rhizome.  
- For whole‑plant harvest, wait until foliage yellowing, then lift the plant, clean, and trim.

### Storage

- **Short term:** Room temperature or airtight fridge container, **unpeeled**.  
- **Long term:** Peel, **freeze**, or **dry** and grind into powder.  
- *Caution:* Fresh turmeric can **permanently stain** clothing, cutting boards, and utensils.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention / Fix |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Irregular brown spots that dry into scabs; premature leaf/flower drop | Water at soil level, discard fallen debris, practice crop rotation |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium wilt** | Root‑borne wilt; leaves/branches wilt, dry, yellow | Use resistant varieties, remove infected plants and soil, maintain garden hygiene, rotate crops |
| **Rotten rhizomes** | Rot, no roots/shoots, stunted yellow leaves | Plant in well‑draining soil, raised beds or containers, avoid overwatering before shoots emerge |
