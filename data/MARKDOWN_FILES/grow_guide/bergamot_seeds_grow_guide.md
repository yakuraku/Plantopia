## Preparation

- **Choose the right spot**  
  - *Perennial varieties* need a permanent location where they won’t be disturbed by digging.  
  - *Annuals* can be moved more freely, but still prefer a stable spot.

- **Sunlight**  
  - Bergamot loves **full sun to part shade**. Aim for at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.

- **Soil**  
  - Use a **well‑drained, organic‑rich mix**.  
  - Weeding, loosening, and adding aged animal manure or compost will give your plants a healthy start.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.

- **Containers**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, pick a variety that’s *container‑friendly*.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of **at least 20 L** (5 gal).  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the growing season.

## Common Problems When Growing Bergamot

| Pest / Issue | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may leave honeydew and attract ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that nibble tender leaves at night, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, use poultry, torchlight collection, or traps. |
| **Spider Mites** | Tiny (Tetranychus urticae) that cause dry, wilted, or discoloured leaves; undersides feel sandpapery. | Prune for airflow, spray eco‑oil or wettable sulphur. |
| **Thrips** | Black, beige, or white flying insects (<1.5 mm) with larvae that leave tiny white or transparent marks. | Hose off, encourage predatory mites and lacewings, or spray soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insects similar to aphids, often in large numbers on leaf undersides. | Hose off, spray soap, or attract beneficial predators. Severely infested plants may need to be destroyed. |
