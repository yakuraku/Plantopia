## Preparation

Mint is a *tough* plant once it takes root. To keep it from taking over your garden, give it a **permanent spot** in a bed or grow it in a **container**.  

- **Sunlight:** Full sun to part shade – aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:** Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  1. Weed thoroughly.  
  2. Dig over to loosen.  
  3. Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  4. Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:** If you choose pots, pick a variety suited to container growth.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Minimum size: **10 L** (≈ 2.5 gal).  
  - During the growing season, container plants may need extra fertiliser to stay healthy.

## How to Sow Mint Seeds

Mint seeds are tiny but mighty. They **don’t need any pre‑treatment** (no soaking or stratification).  

1. **Fill** trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sow** seeds **1 mm deep**.  
3. Keep the soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
4. Germination: **10–14 days** at **13–18 °C**.  
5. **Transplant** seedlings once they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. Space plants **30 cm apart** in the garden.  

**Tips for tiny seeds**

- Mix seeds with sand or fine potting mix before sowing to keep them from blowing away.  
- Use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly.  
- Press lightly into the soil surface for good contact.  
- Patience is key—some varieties take longer to germinate, so stick to the depth and temperature guidelines.

## How to Grow Mint

- **Watering:** Keep soil **evenly moist** but avoid waterlogging.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - **Avoid wetting the leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- **Fertilising:**  
  - If soil is already well‑prepared, you can skip extra fertiliser.  
  - For a boost or in poorer soil, use a high‑nitrogen or leafy‑green‑specific fertiliser:  
    - **Slow‑release:** Apply at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - **Liquid:** Follow the recommended rate and frequency during the growing season.

## How to Harvest Mint

- **Timing:** Mint is ready to harvest in **80–100 days**.  
- **Best flavour:** Just before the plant **flowers**—essential oil levels peak.  
- **Method:** Pinch off the outer stems and leaves, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Short‑term: Place in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - Fresh stems: Put in a glass or jar of water.  
  - Long‑term: Dry or freeze in ice‑cube trays.

Mint can face a few common pests and diseases. Here’s what to watch for and how to handle them:

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Management Tips |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Aphids** (2–4 mm) | New shoots, undersides of leaves, honeydew, ants | - Spray with a garden hose<br>- Use soap or alcohol spray<br>- Encourage predatory insects |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._) | Brown/orange raised spots or patches | - Space plants to avoid overcrowding<br>- Provide full sun<br>- Avoid over‑fertilising<br>- Remove dead plant material<br>- Practice crop rotation |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Slimy trails, tender leaf damage (mostly at night) | - Remove hiding places<br>- Keep free‑range poultry<br>- Use torchlight to spot them<br>- Set traps |
| **Whitefly** | Yellowing or wilting leaves, large numbers on leaf undersides | - Hose or soap spray to remove<br>- Destroy severely affected plants<br>- Attract beneficial insects |
