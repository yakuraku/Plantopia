# How to Grow Turnip Seeds  

**Family:** Brassicaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Brassica rapa_  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial (usually grown as an annual)  

## Preparation  
Turnips thrive in **full sun or part shade**—pick a spot that gets at least **3 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  

- **Soil:** Loose, well‑drained, and rich in organic matter.  
  - Weigh out weeds, dig to a spade’s depth, and mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Heavy soils can be lightened by adding organic matter so roots can grow freely.  
- Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

## How to Sow Turnip Seeds  
Turnip seeds are *straightforward*—no soaking or stratification needed.  

1. **Plant** seeds **10 mm deep** and **7–15 cm apart**; keep rows **20–40 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil damp but never soggy or dry.  
3. **Germination:** 5–12 days at **7–25 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

## How to Grow Turnips  
### Watering  
- Check soil 5 cm below the surface; water when it feels dry (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilizing  
- If the soil is well‑prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is needed.  
- Over‑fertilizing can cause lush leaves at the expense of roots.  
- In poor soil, use a **low‑nitrogen, high‑phosphorus** fertilizer (e.g., blood and bone) at the recommended rate.

## How to Harvest Turnips  
Turnips are ready in **50–90 days**.  

### Leaves  
- Harvest when leaves are large enough to eat.  
- Pinch off outer leaves, leaving some on the plant for regrowth.  
- Consume or store promptly: keep in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge for short‑term use.

### Roots  
- Pull gently at the base of the leaves or use a garden fork to lift multiple roots.  
- Shake off excess soil, cut foliage **1–2 cm** above the root.  
- Store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
- For longer storage, consider canning or blanching and freezing.

## Common Problems When Growing Turnips  
Below are the most frequent issues and how to tackle them:

### Cabbage Moth & Cabbage White Butterfly  
- **Signs:** White/grey wings, distinctive markings; caterpillars create holes or skeletonize leaves.  
- **Prevention:** Use netting or decoys to deter them.  
- **Control:** Pick caterpillars off or apply a targeted spray.

### Bolting  
- **What it is:** Premature flowering and seeding.  
- **Causes:** Extreme weather, early sowing, heat stress.  
- **Solution:** Wait until after frost danger or very hot periods; water deeply during heat.

### Split Roots  
- **Cause:** Inconsistent watering when roots mature.  
- **Fix:** Water deeply and evenly; factor in recent or expected rainfall.

### Small Roots  
- **Reason:** Over‑sowing or over‑fertilizing.  
- **Fix:** Thin seedlings to give roots space; avoid fertilizing during early growth.

### Tough Roots  
- **Indicator:** Roots harvested too late.  
- **Solution:** Harvest when roots are young and tender.

### Aphids  
- **Description:** 2–4 mm sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may wilt or discolor leaves and produce honeydew attracting ants.  
- **Management:**  
  - Spray with a garden hose.  
  - Use soap or alcohol spray.  
  - Encourage predatory insects.

### Whitefly  
- **Similar to aphids** but often found in large numbers on leaf undersides.  
- **Symptoms:** Yellowing, wilting, slowed growth.  
- **Control:** Hose spray or soap spray; severely affected plants may need removal.  
- **Beneficial insects** can help keep populations down.
