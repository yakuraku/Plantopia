# How to Grow Nasturtium Seeds

**Family:** Tropaeolaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Tropaeolum majus_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

Nasturtiums are notorious for self‑seeding. At the end of the season they drop seeds that can germinate the next year.  
- **If you want them to stay wild:** choose a spot that welcomes new plants.  
- **If you prefer control:** deadhead before seed drop or grow in containers.

**Sunlight:** Full sun or part shade. Aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** daily.  

**Soil:**  
- Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
- Weed thoroughly, dig to loosen, then mix in aged animal manure or compost.  
- Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

**Containers:**  
- Use a variety suited for container growth.  
- Minimum **20 L pot** for mature nasturtiums.  
- Container plants may need extra fertiliser during the season.

## How to Sow Nasturtium Seeds

Nasturtium seeds need no pre‑treatment (no soaking or stratification).  
You can **sow directly** in the garden or **raise seedlings** in trays and transplant later.

### Sow Direct

1. **Plant** seeds **15 mm deep** and **30–45 cm apart**.  
2. Keep soil **moist but never water‑logged**.  
3. Germination takes **7–14 days** at **16–20 °C**.  
4. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until established.

### Raise Seedlings

1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a quality seed‑raising mix (or soil starter pellets).  
2. **Sow** seeds **15 mm deep**.  
3. Maintain **moist but not saturated** soil.  
4. Germinate in **7–14 days** at **16–20 °C**.  
5. Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. Space plants **30–45 cm apart** when planting out.

## How to Grow Nasturtium

### Watering

- Water when the soil is dry **≈ 5 cm below the surface** (check by finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising

- If soil is well‑prepared, no extra fertiliser is needed.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertiliser:

  * **Slow‑release**: apply at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  * **Liquid**: apply at the recommended rate during fruiting or flowering.

### Support & Growth Habit

- Nasturtiums can **sprawl** or climb a trellis, wire fence, or tripod.  
- When using support, tie gently with twine or plant ties.  
- **Set up support before sowing** to avoid disturbing roots later.

### Flowering & Deadheading

- Flowers appear in **≈ 70–80 days**.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading or dead flowers just above a set of leaves with sharp secateurs or snips.  
- Removing old blooms encourages more flowering.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Pest/Disease | Symptoms | Management |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** (2–4 mm) | New shoots or leaf undersides, wilting, honeydew, ants | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, attract predatory insects |
| **Cabbage Moth / White Butterfly** | Eggs on leaf undersides, caterpillars create holes or skeletonise leaves | Use netting, pick caterpillars, apply selective sprays |
| **Thrips** (<1.5 mm) | Tiny white or transparent marks on leaves and petals, potential pathogen spread | Wash with a hose, encourage predatory mites/lacewings, use soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil |
| **Whitefly** | Yellowing or wilting leaves, slow growth, dense swarms on leaf undersides | Hose spray, soap spray, remove severely affected plants, attract beneficial predators |
