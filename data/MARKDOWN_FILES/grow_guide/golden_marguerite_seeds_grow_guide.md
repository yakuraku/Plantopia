# How to Grow Golden Marguerite Seeds  

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Anthemis tinctoria_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Golden marguerite thrives in **full sun** – aim for at least **6 hours of direct light** each day.  
- **Location:** As a perennial, give it a **permanent spot** where it won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use **well‑drained soil** rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly **weed** the area, then **dig over** to loosen the ground.  
  - Add **aged animal manure** or **compost** to boost fertility.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Tip:* Learn more about preparing soil for planting [here](#).  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, choose a variety **recommended for container growing**.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and ensure the container is **at least 10 L** in volume.  
  - Remember that container plants often need **extra fertiliser** during the growing season.  

## How to Sow Golden Marguerite Seeds  

Golden marguerite seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification required.  

1. **Seed‑raising mix**  
   - Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **good quality seed‑raising mix** (or use soil starter pellets).  
2. **Sowing depth**  
   - Sprinkle seeds **2 mm deep**.  
3. **Moisture**  
   - Keep the soil **moist** but **never wet or dry**.  
4. **Germination**  
   - Seeds should sprout in **14–28 days** at a soil temperature of **18–21 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting**  
   - Move seedlings to the garden once they develop their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing**  
   - Plant out at **35 cm apart**.  

*Optional:* In cooler climates, start indoors **6 weeks before the last expected frost**. Grow them in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.  

## How to Grow Golden Marguerite  

### Watering  

- **When to water:** Check the soil **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger). Water when it feels dry.  
- **Best times:** Early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid leaf wetting:** This helps prevent fungal diseases.  
- *Learn more about watering* [here](#).  

### Fertilising  

- **Well‑prepared soil:** Usually no extra fertiliser needed.  
- **Boosting growth:**  
  - Use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertiliser.  
  - **Slow‑release**: Apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - **Liquid**: Apply during flowering or fruiting, following the recommended rate and frequency.  

### Flowering  

- **Bloom time:** Roughly **60–80 days** after planting.  
- **Deadheading:**  
  - Cut fading or dead flowers **just above a set of leaves** with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - Regular deadheading encourages more blooms.  
  - *More on deadheading* [here](#).  

### Cutting for Flowers  

- For cut stems, use **sharp snips or secateurs** to cut the **longest stems possible**.  
- Remove lower leaves and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.  
- *Learn more about cutting and conditioning* [here](#).  

### Pruning  

- After flowering, prune back to tidy the plant and stimulate strong new growth.  
- Cut individual stems **just above a set of lower leaves** with sharp tools.  

## Common Problems When Growing Golden Marguerite  

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves, especially at night; leave slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, collect by torchlight, or use traps. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread to cover leaves; reduces yield but rarely fatal. | Water at soil level (not on leaves), improve airflow, remove affected leaves, and spray with a suitable fungicide or homemade remedy. |
