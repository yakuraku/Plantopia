# How to Grow Paper Daisy Seeds

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Rhodanthe sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Paper daisies thrive in *full sun*—pick a spot that receives **at least 6 hours of direct sunshine** each day.  
- **Soil:** They need *very well‑drained* soil.  
  - No extra manure or fertilisers are usually required.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area and loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, choose a container that’s **recommended for container growing**.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Aim for a minimum of **20 L** to give the plant room to grow.  
  - Remember that container plants may need a bit more fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Paper Daisy Seeds

Paper daisy seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking or stratification needed.

- **Light exposure** can boost germination, so press the seeds onto damp soil and lightly cover with fine soil.
- You can sow them **directly in the garden** or **raise seedlings** in trays and transplant later.

### Sow Direct

1. **Depth & spacing:** Sow 1 mm deep, 15–25 cm apart.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil *moist but never water‑logged or dry*.  
3. **Germination:** Seeds sprout in **7–14 days** at 10–20 °C.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raise Seedlings

1. **Containers:** Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sowing:** 1 mm deep, same moisture rule as above.  
3. **Germination:** 7–14 days at 10–20 °C.  
4. **Transplanting:** Move seedlings when they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
5. **Spacing:** Plant out 15–25 cm apart.

> **Tip:** Try the *scatter seed* method—roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly smooth over.  

## How to Grow Paper Daisy

- **Watering:**  
  - Once established, paper daisies are drought‑tolerant.  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings; only water when the soil is dry about **10 cm below the surface** (check by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  
- **Fertiliser:** They thrive in nutrient‑poor soil; no extra fertiliser is needed during the growing season.  
- **Flowering:** Expect blooms in **80–90 days**.  
- **Cut Flowers:**  
  - Use sharp snips or secateurs to cut the longest stems.  
  - Remove lower leaves and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.  
  - *Learn more about cutting and conditioning homegrown flowers here.*  
- **Deadheading:**  
  - Regularly trim fading or dead flowers just above a set of leaves.  
  - This encourages more blooms.

## Common Problems When Growing Paper Daisies

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; can cover entire leaf surface. | Water at soil level (not on leaves), improve airflow, remove affected leaves, and spray with a suitable fungicide or homemade spray. *Read more about powdery mildew here.* |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that nibble tender leaves at night, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, use torchlight to collect them, or set traps. *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
