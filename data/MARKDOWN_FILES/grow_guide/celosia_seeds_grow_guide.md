## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Celosia loves *full sun* – pick a spot that gets **at least 6 h of direct sunshine** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed the area, dig the soil to loosen it, and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
  - *Tip:* For a deeper soil prep guide, see [Preparing Soil for Planting](#).

## How to Sow Celosia Seeds

Celosia seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking, stratification, or special treatment needed.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sprinkle seeds **3 mm deep** and **20 cm apart** in the garden. |
| 2 | Keep the soil **moist but never waterlogged**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–14 days** at **21–27 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a high‑quality seed‑raising mix (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **3 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist but not soggy** soil. |
| 4 | Germinate in **7–14 days** at **21–27 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **20 cm apart** in the garden. |

> **Frost Alert:** Celosia is frost‑sensitive. *Never sow or transplant outdoors until the danger of frost has passed.*  
> In cooler regions, start seeds indoors **6 weeks before the last expected frost** in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Celosia

### Watering

- **When to Water:** Check the soil 5 cm below the surface; if it feels dry, it’s time to water.  
- **Method:** Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid:** Spraying water directly onto leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- *More on watering:* [Watering Guide](#).

### Fertilizing

- **If soil is already rich:** No extra fertilizer needed.  
- **If soil is poor or you want a boost:**  
  - *Slow‑release fertilizer:* Apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - *Liquid fertilizer:* Use at the recommended rate and frequency during flowering or fruiting.

### Support & Pruning

| Variety | Support | Pruning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Cockscomb** | Use stakes, bamboo canes, trellises, or string lines. Install support **before sowing** to avoid root disturbance. | – |
| **Plume & Wheat** | – | Pinch off the top set of leaves (just above a lower leaf) with sharp secateurs or snips to encourage denser growth, stronger stems, and more flowers. |

- **Flowering Time:** Approximately **85 days** from sowing.

### Cutting for Flowers

- Use **sharp snips or secateurs** to cut the longest stems possible.  
- Remove lower leaves and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Irregular brown spots that dry into scab‑like patches; premature leaf and flower drop. | Water at soil level (not on leaves), discard fallen debris, practice crop rotation. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Tender leaves and shoots eaten, slimy trails at night. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use traps, or spot‑treat with safe molluscicides. |
| **Spider Mites** | Dry, wilted, or discolored leaves; undersides feel sandpaper‑like. | Prune for better airflow, spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulfur. |
