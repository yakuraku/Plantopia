# How to Grow Anemone Corms  

**Family:** Ranunculaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Anemone coronaria_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Anemones thrive in **full sun**—pick a spot that gets at least **6 h of direct light** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **loose, well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area, dig to at least a spade’s depth, and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - In heavy soils, this lightens the ground so roots can grow freely.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.

- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, choose a variety suited for container life.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of at least **10 L**.  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the growing season.  

## How to Plant Anemone Corms  

1. **Optional soaking:**  
   - Soak corms in **room‑temperature water** for **1–3 h** before planting.  
   - They should swell; do **not** exceed the time limit to avoid rot.  
2. **Planting depth & spacing:**  
   - Place each corm **10 cm apart** and **4 cm deep** with the point facing down.  
   - In subtropical zones, dig **8 cm deep** to shield from warm surface soil.  
3. **Cover & water:**  
   - Backfill with soil and water **well**.  
   - Keep the soil **moist but not waterlogged** until shoots appear.  

## How to Grow Anemone  

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil moisture by feeling **5 cm below the surface**.  
  - Water deeply in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is already rich, skip extra fertilizer.  
  - For poorer soil or a boost:  
    - *Slow‑release* fertilizer at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - *Liquid* fertilizer at the recommended rate/frequency during flowering.  
- **Flowering:**  
  - Expect blooms in **90–110 days**.  
  - **Deadhead** regularly: snip fading flowers just above a leaf set with sharp secateurs.  
  - For cut‑flower use, cut the longest stems, remove lower leaves, and place immediately in clean water.

## Lifecycle Options  

| Option | How to Manage | Lifespan |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Annual** | Discard after flowering. | 1 season |
| **Naturalise** | Leave in the garden; rebloom next year. | 2–3 years (short‑lived) |
| **Perennial** | Lift, store, and replant in autumn. | 2–3 years (if left naturalised) |

### Lifting & Storing Corms  

1. Wait until foliage turns **yellow**.  
2. Cut foliage at ground level.  
3. Use a garden fork to lift corms, handling gently.  
4. Spread on a wire rack in a **cool, dry** spot for **10–14 days** to dry.  
5. Store in a **net bag** until autumn replanting.  

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes  

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots/undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap/alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level, remove/destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding. If persistent, use homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, apply appropriate fungicide or homemade spray. *Read more here.* |
| **Rotten Corms** | Corms sit in cold, wet soil or are waterlogged; may show rot or lack roots/shoots. | Do not over‑soak before planting; use free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers. Lift and store over winter if growing perennials. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Tender leaves and shoots eaten at night, slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use torchlight to collect, or set traps. *Read more here.* |
