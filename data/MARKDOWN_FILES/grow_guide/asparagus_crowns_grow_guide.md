# How to Grow Asparagus Crowns  

**Family:** Asparagaceae  
**Binomial name:** *Asparagus officinalis*  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation  

Asparagus is a long‑lived perennial that can produce spears for **20 years or more**. Because they dislike being moved, pick a **permanent spot** that won’t be disturbed by digging or heavy traffic.  

- **Sunlight:** Full sun is essential—aim for **at least 6 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:** Loose, well‑drained loam enriched with organic matter.  
  - Weed the area thoroughly.  
  - Dig to a **spade‑deep** (≈30 cm) to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in aged animal manure or compost to lighten heavy soils and feed roots.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  

> *Tip:* A light layer of mulch after planting helps suppress weeds and retain moisture.

## How to Plant Asparagus Crowns  

1. **Timing:** Plant crowns **right after delivery**.  
2. **Storage:** Keep crowns on a wire rack in a dry place; a little mold is normal. Trim any badly affected roots.  
3. **Spacing:** **30 cm** between crowns.  
4. **Hole:** Dig a **30 cm deep** hole and create a small mound in the center.  
5. **Placement:** Set the crown on the mound, spread the roots evenly.  
6. **Cover:** Backfill with soil, leaving the crown’s center just below the surface.  
7. **Water:** Water thoroughly after planting.  
8. **Mulch:** Apply straw, sugar‑cane mulch, or a similar organic mulch to keep weeds at bay until shoots appear in spring.  

## How to Grow Asparagus  

### Watering  
- Check soil moisture **5 cm** below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  

### Fertilizing  
- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
- In poorer soils or for a boost:  
  - *Slow‑release* fertilizer at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings are **5–10 cm** tall.  
  - *Liquid* fertilizer at the recommended rate and frequency during fruiting or flowering.  

### Harvesting  
- **First year:** Skip harvesting to build strong roots.  
- **Autumn:** When foliage yellows, prune to ground level and mulch the area.  

## How to Harvest Asparagus  

- **Timing:** Spears are ready in **390–420 days** after planting.  
- **Selection:** Harvest when spears emerge and are large enough to eat.  
  - *Thin, young spears* are tender; *thick, mature spears* are heartier.  
- **Method:** Cut just below the soil surface, leaving some spears to support growth.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Short‑term: Keep in a plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - Long‑term: Can, pickle, blanch, then freeze.  

## Common Problems When Growing Asparagus  

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention & Management |
|---------|----------|--------------------------|
| **Rotten crowns** | Crown rot, no roots or shoots, stunted yellow leaves | Plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers. Don’t water crowns over winter unless soil is very dry. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Slimy trails, tender leaf damage (mostly at night) | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, use traps, or spot‑treat with safe molluscicides. |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._) | Brown to orange raised spots or patches on foliage | Space plants to avoid overcrowding, provide full sun, avoid over‑fertilizing, remove dead material, practice crop rotation. |
| **Aphids** | Small sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; wilting, discoloration, honeydew attracting ants | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, encourage predatory insects (ladybirds, lacewings). |

> *Remember:* Early detection and prompt action keep your asparagus thriving and disease‑free.
