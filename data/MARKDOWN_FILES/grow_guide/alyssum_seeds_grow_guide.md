# How to Grow Alyssum Seeds

**Family:** Brassicaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Lobularia maritima_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

---

## Preparation

Alyssum is a *self‑seeding* perennial that will happily drop seeds onto the soil at the end of each season. If you want a fresh crop next year, simply choose a spot where new plants will thrive.  
- **Want to keep it contained?** Deadhead before seed drop or grow in containers.  
- **Sunlight:** Full sun to part shade – aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** daily.  
- **Soil:** Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  1. Weed thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  3. Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  4. Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  

*Tip:* For container growing, pick a variety labeled “container‑friendly.” Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot of **≥10 L**. Container plants often need a little extra fertilizer to stay healthy.

## How to Sow Alyssum Seeds

Alyssum seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification required.  
You can sow them straight into the garden or raise seedlings first.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sprinkle seeds **2 mm** deep, **20 cm** apart. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but not soggy**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–14 days** at **18–22 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **2 mm** deep. |
| 3 | Maintain moist soil (never waterlogged). |
| 4 | Germinate in **7–14 days** at **18–22 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm** tall. |
| 6 | Space plants **20 cm** apart in the garden. |

**Scatter‑seed method:** Roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil. This is a quick and forgiving way to sow.

## How to Grow Alyssum

### Watering

- **When to water:** Check 5 cm below the surface; if dry, water.  
- **Best times:** Early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid:** Wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk.  

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil:** No extra fertilizer needed.  
- **Poor soil or a boost:** Use a high‑potassium or flowering‑plant fertilizer.  
  - *Slow‑release:* Apply at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - *Liquid:* Apply during fruiting or flowering at the recommended rate.  

### Thinning

- When seedlings are large enough, thin to **20 cm** spacing by pulling out weaker ones.  

### Flowering

- **Bloom time:** About **60 days** after sowing.  
- **Deadheading:** Trim faded flowers just above a leaf set with sharp secateurs or snips. This encourages continuous blooming.  

### Pruning (Mountain Gold only)

- After flowering, prune back to **≈½** of the plant’s size to tidy and stimulate new growth.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | Symptoms | Remedy |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides | Water at soil level, remove affected leaves, ensure good airflow. If persistent, spray with homemade milk spray or a fungicide. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Slimy trails, tender leaf damage, mainly at night | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use traps, or spot‑treat with slug‑repellent. |
