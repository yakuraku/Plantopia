## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Corn loves full sun – aim for **at least 6 h of direct sunshine** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed the area thoroughly, then dig or till to loosen the soil.  
  - Work in **aged animal manure or compost** for a nutrient boost.  
- **Weed control:** Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
- *Tip:* For a deeper dive into soil prep, check out our guide on preparing soil for planting.

## How to Sow Corn Seeds

Corn doesn’t need any pre‑treatment (no soaking or stratification).  
**Direct sow** for best results.

1. **Depth & spacing**  
   - Sow 15–25 mm deep.  
   - Space seeds **20–30 cm apart** within a row.  
   - Keep rows **50–90 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture** – keep soil consistently moist, but **never soggy or dry**.  
3. **Germination** – 5–14 days at 16–35 °C.  
4. **Protection** – shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  

**Block planting** is key: corn is wind‑pollinated, so planting in blocks (rather than long rows) encourages pollen transfer and yields more uniform kernels.

**Frost warning:** Corn is frost‑sensitive. **Never transplant or sow outside until the danger of frost has passed.**

## How to Grow Corn

- **Watering**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface; water when it feels dry.  
  - Water deeply in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *More watering tips:* see our watering guide.  

- **Fertilizing**  
  - If the soil was well‑prepared, you may not need extra fertilizer.  
  - In poorer soils or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertilizer** – apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - **Liquid fertilizer** – apply at the recommended rate/frequency during fruiting or flowering.

## How to Harvest Corn

### Sweet Corn

- **Ready to harvest** when the silks at the end of the cobs turn brown and dry.  
- **Test**: Partially strip the husk, pierce a kernel – if the juice is milky, it’s ready.  
- **Harvesting technique**: Hold the cob firmly, pull downwards while twisting to detach it from the stem.  
- **Enjoy quickly**: Eat fresh or store short‑term in the fridge (with or without husk).  
- **Long‑term storage**: Blanch and freeze.

### Maize (Dry Corn)

- **Ready to harvest** when silks and husks are dry and brown.  
- **Harvest**: Same method as sweet corn.  
- **Post‑harvest**: Remove husks, hang or spread cobs on a wire rack in a bright, well‑ventilated area for 2–3 weeks until kernels are dry (not squishy).  
- **Storage**: Keep cobs in a cool, dry place, or remove kernels and store in an airtight container.

## Common Problems When Growing Corn

| Problem | What Happens | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots/undersides of leaves; can wilt leaves and produce honeydew that attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose or a soap/alcohol solution.<br>• Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Empty/Missing Kernels** | Poor pollination – each kernel needs wind‑borne pollen from tassels to silks. Causes: few plants, insect damage to silks, water stress. | • Plant in blocks.<br>• Manage insect pests.<br>• Water regularly when silks appear.<br>• Hand‑shake tassels into a bowl and dip silks to transfer pollen. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that nibble tender leaves/shoots, especially at night, leaving slimy trails. | • Remove hiding spots.<br>• Keep free‑range poultry.<br>• Use torchlight to spot and trap.<br>• Set up traps. |
| **Armyworms, Cutworms & Other Caterpillars** | Eat inside fruit, leaving holes. | • Inspect fruit regularly.<br>• Remove caterpillars by hand.<br>• Use insect‑exclusion netting or fruit bags.<br>• Spray with Dipel if needed. |
| **Possums, Birds & Other Animals** | Can destroy a large portion of the harvest overnight. | • Use netting or cages.<br>• Try homemade deterrents (garlic, fish oil, mustard spray). |
