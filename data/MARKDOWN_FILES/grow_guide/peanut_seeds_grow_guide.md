# How to Grow Peanut Seeds

**Family:** Fabaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Arachis hypogaea_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hrs of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Loose, well‑drained loam enriched with **organic matter**.  
  - Thoroughly weed, then dig to a *spade’s depth* to loosen the ground.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost**—this lightens heavy soil and feeds roots.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a variety labeled for container growing.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot of **≥ 20 L**.  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the season.

## How to Sow Peanut Seeds

> *Optional:* Soak seeds overnight in room‑temperature water before planting.

Peanuts can be sown **directly in the garden** or **raised in trays** and transplanted once established.

### Sow Direct

1. **Depth & Spacing:** Plant 30 mm deep, 15–30 cm apart, with rows 60 cm apart.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil **moist but never waterlogged or dry**.  
3. **Germination:** 7–15 days at 18–22 °C.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re sturdy.

### Raise Seedlings

1. **Containers:** Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots filled with a quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Planting:** Sow 30 mm deep.  
3. **Moisture:** Same rule—moist but not soggy.  
4. **Germination:** 7–15 days at 18–22 °C.  
5. **Transplanting:** Move seedlings when they have their first true leaves and are 5–10 cm tall.  
6. **Spacing:** Plant out 15–30 cm apart, rows 60 cm apart.

> **Frost Alert:** Peanut is frost‑sensitive. Don’t transplant or sow outdoors until the danger of frost has passed.  
> *Optional:* In cooler climates, start seeds indoors 6 weeks before the last expected frost. Keep them warm with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Peanut

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface; water when it’s dry (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually suffices.  
  - Some gardeners sprinkle **½ a handful of gypsum per plant** during flowering to boost calcium for shell formation.

- **Flowering & Peg Formation:**  
  - Plants flower ~40 days after germination.  
  - After pollination, fertilized flowers become **pegs** that drop to the ground.  
  - Pods develop underground: shells form first, then peanuts.  
  - **Do not prune flowers or pegs**—this stops peanut production.

## How to Harvest Peanuts

- **Timing:** Harvest 90–130 days after planting, when foliage turns yellow and dies back.  
- **Ripeness Check:** Pick one plant; the shell should show prominent veins, and peanut skins should be colored, not white.  
- **Harvesting Steps:**  
  1. Use a garden fork to gently lift whole plants.  
  2. Shake off excess soil.  
  3. **Curing:** Let plants sit for ~1 week on the soil, or hang them in bunches in a warm, dry spot if rodents are a concern.  
  4. Separate shells from dried plants; discard immature or “green” pods (soft with uncolored peanuts).  
  5. Dry shells on a wire rack in a cool, dry place for 1–2 weeks.  
  6. Store in a mesh bag or freeze for long‑term preservation.  
  7. Peanuts can be kept in shells or shelled.

## Common Problems When Growing Peanuts

Peanuts can face a few pests and diseases. Here are the most common issues and how to tackle them:

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention / Fix |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Irregular brown spots on leaves and stems that dry into scab‑like patches; premature leaf and flower drop | Water at soil level (not on foliage), discard fallen leaves and fruit, practice crop rotation |

> *Tip:* Keep foliage dry and maintain good airflow to reduce disease pressure.
