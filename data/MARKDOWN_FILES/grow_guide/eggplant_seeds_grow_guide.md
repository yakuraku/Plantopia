# How to Grow Eggplant Seeds

**Family:** Solanaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Solanum melongena_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Eggplants thrive in *full sun* – aim for at least **6 hours of direct light** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Choose a *well‑drained* bed enriched with plenty of organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen the soil, and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, pick a variety labeled “container‑friendly.”  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a **minimum of 40 L** (≈10 gal) pot for mature plants.  
  - Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Eggplant Seeds

Eggplant seeds are *easy to start* – no soaking or stratification required.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep** in the garden, spacing **50–80 cm** apart, with rows **60–100 cm** apart. |
| 2 | Keep the soil **moist but not waterlogged**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–14 days** at a soil temperature of **24–32 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist but not soggy** soil. |
| 4 | Germinate in **7–14 days** at **24–32 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Plant out at **50–80 cm spacing**, rows **60–100 cm** apart. |

> **Tip:** Eggplants are frost‑sensitive. **Never plant outdoors** until all danger of frost has passed.  
> In cooler climates, start seeds indoors **6 weeks before the last expected frost** in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Eggplant

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil feels dry **≈5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- **Fertilising:**  
  - If the soil was well prepared, no extra fertiliser is needed.  
  - For a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid** fertilizer during fruiting or flowering, following the product’s recommended rate and frequency.  
- **Support:**  
  - Eggplants need staking. Use a sturdy stake, trellis, or tripod.  
  - Tie stems gently with twine or plant ties as they grow.  
  - Set up support **before planting** to avoid disturbing roots later.  
- **Growth Habit:**  
  - In tropical/subtropical zones, eggplants can fruit *year‑round*.  
  - In temperate/cool climates, treat them as warm‑season annuals.  
  - To grow perennials in cool areas: plant in a sheltered spot, protect from frost, or overwinter by potting up and moving indoors. Prune hard in early winter and remove damaged foliage in spring.

## How to Harvest Eggplants

- **Timing:** Harvest 70–120 days after sowing.  
- **Readiness:** Fruit should be firm with a glossy skin.  
- **Method:** Cut with snips or scissors, leaving **≈3 cm of stem**.  
- **Harvesting Frequency:** Pick regularly to encourage more fruit.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Short term: room temperature.  
  - Longer term: refrigerate.  
  - For extended storage: grill, bake, freeze, or preserve in oil.

## Common Problems When Growing Eggplants

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap/alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Queensland Fruit Fly** *(Bactrocera tryoni)* | Eggs laid in fruit; fruit rots from inside, falls prematurely; larvae visible when cut open. | Dispose of fallen fruit, use insect‑exclusion netting, install traps. |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insects on leaf undersides; yellowing leaves, wilting, slowed growth. | Hose spray, soap spray, attract beneficial insects. Severely affected plants may need removal. |
| **Blossom End Rot** | Dark, hard discoloration from the bottom up; caused by calcium deficiency and inconsistent watering. | Discard affected fruit, water regularly and evenly, correct soil pH and nutrients. |
| **Sunscald** | White marks or blisters on fruit, often mounded; young fruit most at risk. | Avoid pruning leaves during peak summer; cover plants with light fabric on hot days. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots on leaves that spread quickly; reduces yield. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Possums, Birds, Other Animals** | Can destroy harvest overnight. | Use netting or cages; try homemade sprays (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium Wilt** | Soil‑borne fungi; roots block water/nutrient flow; leaves wilt, dry, yellow. | No cure; use resistant varieties, dispose of infected plants, practice good hygiene and crop rotation. |
| **Cutworms** | Moth larvae in soil; chew through tender stems at night. | Hand‑pick at night, use cardboard collars around seedlings. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scabs; leaves and flowers drop early. | Water at soil level, discard fallen debris, rotate crops. |
