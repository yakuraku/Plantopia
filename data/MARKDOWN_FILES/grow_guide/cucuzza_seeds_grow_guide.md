# How to Grow Cucuzza Seeds

**Family:** Curcurbitaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Lagenaria siceraria_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Cucuzza loves *full sun*—pick a spot that gets at least **6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Choose a well‑drained bed rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen, and enrich with aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.

## How to Sow Cucuzza Seeds

- **No pre‑treatment needed:** Cucuzza seeds are ready to plant straight away—no soaking or stratification required.  
- **Direct sowing is best:**  
  1. **Depth & spacing:** Plant 25 mm deep, 60 cm apart, with rows 100 cm apart.  
  2. **Moisture:** Keep soil consistently moist—never waterlogged or dry.  
  3. **Germination:** Expect 7–10 days at a soil temperature of **21–35 °C**.  
  4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  
- **Frost caution:** Cucuzza is frost‑sensitive. **Never transplant or sow outdoors** until the danger of frost has passed.

## How to Grow Cucuzza

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil moisture by feeling 5 cm below the surface.  
  - Water deeply in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk.

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If soil is already rich, skip extra fertilizer.  
  - In poorer soils or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release:** Apply at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - **Liquid:** Use during fruiting or flowering, following the product’s rate and frequency.  

- **Support & Spacing:**  
  - **Ground growth:** Allocate at least **2 m² per plant**.  
  - **Trellis:** Vines will climb using tendrils; add gentle ties or twine for extra support.  
  - **Large fruit:** Use a sling made from netting to keep weight off the vine.  
  - **Set up support early:** Install when sowing or transplanting to avoid disturbing roots later.  

- **Mulch tip:** Mulch under ripening fruit with straw or sugar cane to keep rot at bay.

## How to Harvest Cucuzza

- **Timing:** Harvest around **70 days** after sowing.  

- **As a vegetable:**  
  - Look for a glossy skin and a fruit size that’s easy to handle.  
  - Pick when the fruit is tender; older fruit can become tough.  
  - Cut with a small stem attached.  

- **As an ornament:**  
  - Harvest when stems harden or leaves dry and brown.  
  - Leave **5–10 cm** of stem on the fruit.  
  - **Curing:** Let fruit dry for a week in a single layer, airy spot away from direct sun and frost.  
  - **Storage:** Keep in a dark, dry place at **10–16 °C**. Rotate regularly and discard any that rot.

## Common Problems When Growing Cucuzza

| Problem | What to Watch For | Quick Fix |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Not setting fruit** | Flowers drop or tiny fruit shrivel—often due to poor pollination. | Ensure both male and female flowers are present; hand‑pollinate with a paintbrush. *Learn more about hand pollination here.* |
| **Animals (possums, birds, etc.)** | Sudden loss of harvest overnight. | Use netting or cages; try a homemade spray of garlic, fish oil, or mustard. |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; can reduce yield. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, and apply a suitable fungicide or homemade spray. *Read more about powdery mildew here.* |
