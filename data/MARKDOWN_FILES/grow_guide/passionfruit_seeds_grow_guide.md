## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot** – Passionfruit vines thrive when left undisturbed for years.  
- **Sunlight:** Aim for **at least 6 h of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, loosen the soil, and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Tip:* A good soil test can help you fine‑tune amendments.

## How to Sow Passionfruit Seeds

### Scarification (Boost Germination)

Scarifying breaks the hard seed coat so water can reach the embryo.

| Method | How to do it |
|--------|--------------|
| **Knife** | Make a shallow nick on each seed’s shell. |
| **Sandpaper / Nail file** | Gently wear away a small section of the husk. |

*Read more about scarification here.*

### Options for Planting

| Method | Steps |
|--------|-------|
| **Direct Sowing** | 1. Plant 8 mm deep, 200 cm apart (rows 200 cm apart).  <br>2. Keep soil **moist but not waterlogged**.  <br>3. Germination: 21–84 days at 20–30 °C.  <br>4. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and weather. |
| **Raised Seedlings** | 1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  <br>2. Sow 8 mm deep.  <br>3. Keep soil moist but not saturated.  <br>4. Germination: 21–84 days at 20–30 °C.  <br>5. Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are 5–10 cm tall.  <br>6. Space plants 200 cm apart, rows 200 cm apart. |

> **Important:** Passionfruit is frost‑sensitive. **Never plant outside until the danger of frost has passed.**  
> *Tip:* Some varieties germinate slowly—be patient and stick to the depth and temperature guidelines.

## How to Grow Passionfruit

### Watering

- Water when the soil feels **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
- **Deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering is best.  
- **Avoid wetting the leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- *Learn more about watering here.*

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
- If soil is poor or you want a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release fertilizer** – apply at transplant or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
  - **Liquid fertilizer** – apply during fruiting or flowering, following the recommended rate and frequency.

### Support & Pruning

- Passionfruit vines need a **trellis or sturdy support**.  
- **Tie gently** with twine or plant ties; set up the support before sowing or transplanting to avoid root disturbance.  
- In **frosty climates** vines die back in winter and regrow from roots in spring.  
- In **warm climates**, prune stems back to ~1 m from the ground at the start of spring.

## How to Harvest Passionfruit

- **Harvest window:** 595–730 days after planting.  
- **When ripe:** Fruit falls off the vine.  
- **Regular picking** prevents rotting or animal theft.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Room temperature for short periods.  
  - For longer storage, freeze the pulp.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap/alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Virus‑related leaf distortion** | Crinkled, mottled leaves; woody fruit; sudden vigor loss. | Remove diseased plants, avoid re‑planting in the same spot, control aphids/mites promptly. |
| **No flowers/fruit** | Lack of pollinators. | Plant companion flowers, provide water/habitat, reduce chemicals, plant multiple vines for better pollination. |
| **Caterpillars (armyworms, cutworms, etc.)** | Holes in fruit, soft interior. | Inspect fruit, remove caterpillars, use netting or fruit bags, spray Dipel if needed. |
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Brown, scab‑like spots that dry. | Water at soil level, remove fallen leaves/fruit, practice crop rotation. |
| **Frost damage** | Wilting, blackened leaves. | Wait for frost to pass before planting; prune damaged leaves before winter. |
| **Fusarium/Verticillium wilt** | Wilting, yellowing, dry leaves. | No cure; use resistant varieties, discard infected plants/soil, maintain hygiene, rotate crops. |
| **Animals (possums, birds, etc.)** | Harvest loss. | Netting, cages, or homemade deterrents (garlic, fish oil, mustard spray). |
| **Queensland Fruit Fly** | Eggs in fruit, premature drop, larvae inside. | Dispose of fallen fruit, use netting, install traps, maintain hygiene. |
| **Yellowing leaves** | Nutrient deficiency. | Apply nitrogen‑rich or leafy‑green fertilizer; use liquid or foliar feed; water deeply afterward. |
