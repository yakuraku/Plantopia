# How to Grow Comfrey Seeds

**Family:** Boraginaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Symphytum officinale_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot** in a garden bed or grow comfrey in containers to keep it from spreading.  
- Comfrey *self‑seeds* at season’s end. If you want it to thrive, pick a location where new plants are welcome.  
  - If you prefer to keep it out, **deadhead** before seed drop or grow it in a pot.  
- **Light:** Full sun or part shade; aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** daily.  
- **Soil:** Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  - Weeding, loosening, and adding aged animal manure or compost are essential.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:** Use a variety suited for pots.  
  - **Potting mix:** High quality.  
  - **Size:** Minimum **20 L** for mature plants.  
  - Container plants may need extra fertilizer during the growing season.  

## How to Sow Comfrey Seeds

> **Tip:** Stratifying seeds (cold treatment) can speed germination.  

1. **Prepare trays or jiffy pots** with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sow** seeds **5 mm deep**.  
3. Keep the soil **moist but not soggy**.  
4. Germination takes **25–30 days** at **20–22 °C**.  
5. **Transplant** seedlings once they develop their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Space** mature plants **60 cm apart** in the garden.  

> **Note:** Some varieties germinate slowly—stay patient and follow the depth/temperature guidelines closely.  

## How to Grow Comfrey

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface; water when dry.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to prevent fungal disease.  
- **Fertilizer:** Comfrey thrives in nutrient‑poor soils; no extra feeding is needed during the growing season.  
- **Winter Care:**  
  - In cold weather, the plant may die back.  
  - **Cut back** just above ground in late autumn, or prune dead foliage in spring.  
- **Harvest Time:** Roughly **365 days** after planting.  

### Harvesting Leaves

- Use leaves for **compost tea**, mulch, or compost.  
- **Harvest individually**: cut at the base, start with outer leaves, leave some on the plant.  
- **Whole‑plant harvest** is possible in autumn; leaves will regrow in spring.  
- **First year:** Harvest sparingly.  

## Common Problems When Growing Comfrey

| Problem | Description | Management |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._) | Brown/orange raised spots or patches on foliage. Spreads by wind or water, especially at 10–20 °C and high humidity. | • Space plants to avoid overcrowding.<br>• Provide recommended light (full sun).<br>• Avoid over‑fertilizing.<br>• Remove dead plants.<br>• Practice crop rotation. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that eat tender leaves and shoots, mainly at night, leaving slimy trails. | • Remove hiding places.<br>• Keep free‑range poultry.<br>• Use torchlight to spot them.<br>• Set up traps. |
