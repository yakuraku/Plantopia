**Family:** Lamiaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Salvia hispanica_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

---

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Chia loves *full sun* – pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Self‑seeding:** Chia will drop seeds onto the soil at season’s end. If you *don’t* want them to take over, deadhead before seed drop or grow in containers.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, loosen the soil, then add aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Container growing:**  
  - Choose a variety suited for pots.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a **minimum of 20 L** pot for mature plants.  
  - Container plants often need extra fertilizer during the growing season.

## How to Sow Chia Seeds

Chia seeds need no pretreatment (no soaking or stratification).

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **3 mm** deep, **30 cm** apart, with rows **150 cm** apart. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist**—never soggy or dry. |
| 3 | Germination takes **1–4 days** at **20–22 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **3 mm** deep. |
| 3 | Maintain moist soil (never wet or dry). |
| 4 | Germinate in **1–4 days** at **20–22 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm** tall. |
| 6 | Space plants **30 cm** apart, rows **150 cm** apart. |

> **Tip:** Chia is frost‑sensitive. Wait until *all* danger of frost has passed before sowing or transplanting outdoors.

> **Scatter method:** For a quick start, roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil.

> **Indoor start:** In cooler climates, sow indoors **6 weeks** before the last expected frost. Keep them warm with plenty of natural light.

## Growing the Plants

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil is dry **5 cm** below the surface (check by scratching a bit of soil).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.  
- **Thinning:** Once seedlings are large enough to handle, thin them to give each plant room to grow. Pull out weak or small seedlings so spacing is about **30 cm**.  
- **Fertilizer:** Chia thrives in nutrient‑poor soils; no extra fertilizer is needed during the growing season.

## Harvesting

- **Timing:** Chia is ready in **≈120 days**.  
- **Microgreens:** Harvest leaves when plants are **2–5 cm** tall by snipping stems at ground level. Eat them fresh for best flavor.  
- **Seeds:**  
  1. Wait until flowers lose petals and begin to dry.  
  2. Cut fading flowers just below the spike with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  3. Place flowers in a paper bag in a dry, warm spot until fully dry.  
  4. Shake the bag to release seeds.  
  5. Remove chaff by screening or winnowing.  
  6. Store seeds in an airtight jar, or vacuum seal and freeze for long‑term storage.

## Common Problems & How to Avoid Them

| Problem | What Happens | Prevention / Fix |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **Damping off** | Fungal infection from soil to seed/seedling; seedlings appear soft, mushy, and die. | Use fresh potting mix, avoid watering foliage, keep soil from becoming waterlogged. |
| **Root rot** | Soil‑borne fungi in wet soil; plants wilt, yellow, and show soft, brown tissue at base. | Reduce soil moisture, add organic matter, keep mulch away from stems. Remove and dispose of affected plants. |
