## Preparation

Pansies love a sunny spot—aim for **at least 3 hours of full sun** each day, or a bright spot in part shade.  

1. **Choose the right soil**  
   * Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
   * Weed thoroughly, then loosen the soil with a fork or tiller.  
   * Mix in aged animal manure or compost for a nutrient boost.  

2. **Keep weeds at bay**  
   * Maintain a weed‑free area until you plant.  

3. **Container care**  
   * If you’re growing in pots, pick a variety suited for containers.  
   * Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot of **at least 10 L**.  
   * Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Pansy Seeds

Pansy seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking or stratification required.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **6 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Keep the soil **moist but never soggy**. |
| 4 | Germination takes **4–7 days** at **17–21 °C**. |
| 5 | When seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**, transplant them to the garden. |
| 6 | Space plants **15–30 cm apart**. |

**Tip:** Seeds germinate best in the dark. Cover them with soil or a light‑blocking board/black plastic until they sprout, then remove the cover.

## How to Grow Pansy

### Watering

* Keep the soil **evenly moist**—never let it dry out or become waterlogged.  
* Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
* Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising

* If the soil is already well‑prepared, you usually **don’t need extra fertiliser**.  
* For poorer soil or a quick boost:  
  * **Slow‑release fertiliser** – apply at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
  * **Liquid fertiliser** – apply during flowering or fruiting, following the recommended rate and frequency.

### Flowering & Deadheading

* Pansies typically **flower in 110–120 days**.  
* **Deadhead** regularly: snip off fading or dead flowers just above a set of leaves with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  * This encourages more blooms and keeps the plant tidy.

## Common Problems When Growing Pansies

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Manage |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Invite predatory insects. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scab‑like patches; leaves and flowers may drop early. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves.<br>• Remove and discard fallen leaves and fruit.<br>• Practice crop rotation. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | • Water at soil level.<br>• Remove and destroy affected leaves.<br>• Avoid overcrowding; improve airflow.<br>• If persistent, use a homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Grey Mould (Botrytis)** | Mouldy flowers and rotting fruit; spores spread by wind, survive in soil or green waste. | • Prune off affected flowers and fruit.<br>• Water at soil level.<br>• Apply an appropriate fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that can cover entire leaves; reduces yield but rarely fatal. | • Water at soil level.<br>• Ensure good airflow.<br>• Remove affected leaves.<br>• Use a suitable fungicide or homemade spray if necessary. |
