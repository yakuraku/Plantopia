## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Purslane loves *full sun* – pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen, and enrich with **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, choose a variety labeled for **container use**.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot of **≥10 L** to give purslane room to grow.  
  - Container plants may need a bit more fertilizer during the season.

## How to Sow Purslane Seeds

Purslane seeds are tiny but mighty—no pre‑treatment needed. You can **direct‑sow** in the garden or **raise seedlings** first.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sprinkle seeds **3 mm** deep, **30 cm** apart. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist**—never soggy or dry. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–10 days** at **15–35 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **3 mm** deep. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist** soil, avoiding both wet and dry extremes. |
| 4 | Germinate in **7–10 days** at **15–35 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm** tall. |
| 6 | Space out in the garden **30 cm** apart. |

**Tip:** For a quick “scatter seed” method, roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly smooth the surface.  
**Tip:** Because the seeds are so small, mix them with sand or fine potting mix before sowing, or use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly. Press lightly into the soil for good contact and keep them from drying out.

## How to Grow Purslane

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil is dry **5 cm** below the surface (test by scratching a bit of soil).  
  - Aim for **deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is already rich, you may skip extra fertilizer.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid** fertilizer during fruiting or flowering, following the product’s rate and frequency.  
- **Thinning:**  
  - Once seedlings are large enough to handle, thin out weak ones so that mature plants are **30 cm** apart.

## How to Harvest Purslane

- **Timing:** Ready to harvest in **50–60 days**.  
- **Method:**  
  - Pick stems by pinching off the outer ones, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
  - Harvest as needed—purslane is best eaten fresh.  
- **Storage:** Keep in a **perforated plastic bag** in the fridge for short‑term use.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Tiny (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Irregular brown spots that dry into scab‑like patches; leaves and flowers may drop early. | Water at soil level only, discard fallen leaves/fruit, practice crop rotation. |
| **Damping Off** | Seeds fail to germinate or seedlings rot at the base, becoming soft and mushy. | Use fresh potting mix, avoid watering foliage, keep soil from becoming waterlogged. |
