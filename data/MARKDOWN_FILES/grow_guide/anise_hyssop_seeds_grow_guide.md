- **Sunlight:** Anise hyssop thrives in **full sun** – aim for at least **6 h of direct light** each day.  
- **Location:** As a perennial, plant it in a **permanent spot** where it won’t be disturbed by regular digging.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs **well‑drained, organic‑rich soil**.  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen, and enrich with **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Tip:* For more on soil prep, see the linked guide.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a variety suited for container growing.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of at least **20 L**.  
  - Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Anise Hyssop Seeds

1. **Optional – Stratify**  
   - Expose seeds to a cold period to break dormancy and boost germination.  
   - Read more about stratification in the linked article.  
2. **Seed‑raising**  
   - Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** or soil starter pellets.  
   - Sow seeds **2 mm deep**.  
   - Keep soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
   - Germination takes **10–20 days** at **20–22 °C**.  
3. **Transplant**  
   - Move seedlings once they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
   - Space plants **40 cm apart** in the garden.  
4. **Indoor start (cool climates)**  
   - Sow indoors **6 weeks before the last frost**.  
   - Provide a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Anise Hyssop

- **Watering**  
  - Water when the soil is dry **5 cm below the surface** (check by scratching a bit of soil).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *More on watering:* see the linked guide.  
- **Fertiliser**  
  - Anise hyssop tolerates **nutrient‑poor soils** and usually needs no extra fertiliser during the season.  
- **Flowering**  
  - Expect flowers in **≈ 80 days**.  
  - **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading or dead flowers just above a leaf set with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - This encourages more blooms.  
  - *More on deadheading:* see the linked article.  
- **Pruning**  
  - After flowering, prune back to tidy the plant and stimulate strong new growth.  
  - Cut stems just above a lower leaf set with sharp tools.

## Common Problems When Growing Anise Hyssop

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Why It Happens | Quick Fixes |
|---------|--------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Warm, humid conditions. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Root Rot** | Slow establishment, yellowing/wilted foliage, soft brown tissue at stem base and roots. | Wet, poorly drained soil. | Reduce soil moisture, add organic matter, keep mulch away from stems. |
| **Spider Mites** | Dry, wilted or discolored leaves; undersides feel sandpaper‑like. | Dry air, high temperatures. | Prune for airflow, spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulphur. |
| **Thrips** | Tiny (≤ 1.5 mm) black/beige/white flies; larvae leave small white or transparent marks on leaves and petals. | Warm, dry conditions. | Wash with a hose, encourage predatory mites/lacewings, spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insects on leaf undersides; yellowing or wilting leaves; growth slows. | Warm, humid conditions. | Hose spray, soap spray, attract beneficial insects. Severely affected plants may need removal. |
