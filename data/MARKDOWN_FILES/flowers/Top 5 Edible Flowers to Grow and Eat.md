> *Top 5 Edible Flowers to Grow and Eat*

The line between a formal flower garden and a sprawling veggie patch can feel hard to cross, but most gardeners already know the perks of adding flowers: they beautify the space, attract pollinators, and—when edible—bring a splash of novelty straight to your plate.

From bright garnishes on salads to star‑players in summer bowls, and even unexpected color in drinks, edible flowers are a fun, flavorful addition to any home garden.

## Important Safety Note

Before you start feasting on blooms, keep these three safety points in mind:

- **Only use flowers from your own garden.** Wild or cultivated flowers from parks, nature strips, or other people’s gardens may carry pesticides, herbicides, or animal waste you don’t want to ingest.
- **Confirm the flower is safe to eat.** Some common varieties—like *digitalis* (foxglove)—are toxic or even lethal. When in doubt, research or consult a reliable source.
- **Start with moderation.** When trying a new flower, eat a small amount first to rule out an allergic reaction.

- **Why grow them?** Easy, fast, and available in both bush and trailing varieties. They’ll flood your garden with bright blooms.

  - Sprinkle fresh petals over salads.  
  - Substitute saffron in rice dishes.
