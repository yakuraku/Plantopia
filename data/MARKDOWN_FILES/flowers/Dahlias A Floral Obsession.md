## The Beginnings of the Dahlia Craze  

| Era | Key Milestones |
|-----|----------------|
| **Late 1700s** | Imported from the mountains of Mexico & Central America; first cultivated as *Georgina*. |
| **Early 1800s** | Renamed in honor of botanist **Andreas Dahl**. |
| **Mid‑1800s** | Hybridisation boom → thousands of double & ball types. |
| **Late 1800s** | Introduction of pompon, cactus, decorative & collarette forms. |
| **1960s‑1990s** | Fell out of favor with minimalist trends; deemed “old‑fashioned” & high‑maintenance. |
| **Today** | Resurgence powered by social media, heirloom interest, and sustainable floristry. |

> **Pro tip:** Even if you’re a beginner, the dahlia’s *ease of growth* makes it a perfect starter plant.
