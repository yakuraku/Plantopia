# Companion Planting: A Brief Overview

## Why Mixed Plantings Beat Monocultures  
- **Monocultures**—large blocks of a single plant—are *rare in nature* and tend to:
  - Become more susceptible to diseases  
  - Invite pest outbreaks  
  - Reduce overall plant health  
- **Diversity** in the garden creates a more resilient ecosystem, making organic growing *easier and more sustainable*.

## How Companion Plants Help  
Companion planting is the intentional pairing of different species to generate mutual benefits. These interactions range from scientifically proven to anecdotal, yet most gardeners find them valuable.

### Key Benefits  
- **Nutrient Enhancement**  
  - *Nitrogen‑fixing legumes* (peas, beans) partner with nitrogen‑hungry plants to enrich soil.  
  - *Dynamic accumulators* lift nutrients from deep layers, releasing them when the plant is harvested.  
- **Pest Management**  
  - Some companions **repel** pests or **distract** them from valuable crops.  
  - Others act as **trap crops**, drawing pests away.  
  - Example: **Carrot + Onion**—their strong scents confuse pests, reducing damage.  
- **Physical Support**  
  - Shade‑providing or ground‑cover plants reduce water loss around roots.  
  - In permaculture “forest” gardens, layered planting mimics natural ecosystems, boosting productivity.

## Nitrogen Fixation & Nutrient Accumulation  
- **Legumes** host beneficial bacteria that convert atmospheric nitrogen into a plant‑usable form.  
- The exact underground pathways of nitrogen transfer are still *under study*, but gardeners widely accept the practice.  
- Pairing **nitrogen‑hungry** species with legumes is a *simple, effective strategy*.

## Pest Management Through Companion Planting  
- **Repellent Plants**: deter specific insects.  
- **Trap Crops**: attract pests to sacrificial plants.  
- **Scent‑Masking**: combining strong‑smelling crops (e.g., carrot & onion) can reduce pest attraction.  
- Always observe your garden; what works in one climate or soil may differ elsewhere.

## Other Practical Advantages  
- **Shade & Ground Cover**: reduce evaporation, protect root zones.  
- **Permaculture Layers**: create vertical and temporal diversity—*the most productive ecosystem on Earth*.  
- Working *with* nature, not against it, minimizes future problems and maximizes yield.

> **Tip:** Start small—experiment with a few companion pairs in a corner of your garden, then expand as you see what thrives best in your local conditions.
