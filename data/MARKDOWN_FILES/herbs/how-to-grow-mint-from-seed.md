## Mint in the Garden

- **Invasive nature** – once established, it’s hard to stop.  
  - **Solution:** Grow in a **container** or a **confined spot**.  
  - A common trick: bury a sturdy pot just below ground level to block underground runners.

- **Plant size**  
  - Mature plants: **30 cm–40 cm** tall.  
  - Dwarf and carpeting varieties available.

- **Leaves**  
  - Size: ~**5 cm × 3 cm**.  
  - Shape: oval, slightly hairy, crinkled edges.  
  - Color: ranges from bright to dark green, with hints of blue, purple, white, or pale yellow streaks.

- **Flowers**  
  - Appear from **mid‑summer**.  
  - Tiny white or pink spikes.  
  - Removing flowers keeps flavor strong; leaving them attracts bees.

## Growing Mint from Seed

1. **Timing** – sow in **spring**; autumn sowing works in warmer climates.  
2. **Sowing**  
   - Sprinkle seeds on the surface of a good‑quality potting mix.  
   - Press gently, cover lightly with a thin layer of mix.  
3. **Light & Moisture**  
   - Place in a bright spot (no direct sun).  
   - Keep evenly moist; germination takes **10–14 days**.

## Transplanting & Ongoing Care

- **When to transplant** – seedlings 5–10 cm tall with at least two true leaves.  
- **Spacing** – 30 cm apart in soil or individual containers.  
- **Sunlight** – at least **3 hours of full sun** per day; partial shade helps in hot climates.  
- **Water** – mint loves moisture; avoid long dry spells.  
- **Fertilizer** – minimal feeding.  
  - Over‑fertilizing reduces aromatic oils.  
  - A slow‑release herb/leafy vegetable fertilizer in spring is enough.

## Extending the Harvest

- **Regular picking** keeps the plant vigorous and prevents it from becoming sparse or woody.  
- **Flower removal** (optional) maintains flavor.  
- If the plant becomes woody:  
  1. Prune stems back to the ground.  
  2. Water and feed.  
  3. Growth should return.

## Hardiness & Winter Care

- **Cool climates** – mint is hardy but goes dormant in winter; it returns in spring.  
- **Warm climates** – evergreen.  
  - Heavy pruning before winter keeps shape and removes overwintering pests.

## Common Mint Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | Symptoms | Remedy |
|---------|----------|--------|
