## Three Ways to Propagate Lemongrass

Choose a method that fits your budget, time, and harvest goals.

### 1. Growing from Seed  
- **When:** Spring or summer (autumn in tropical zones).  
- **How:**  
  1. Sow seeds **5 mm deep** in punnets or trays.  
  2. Keep soil **consistently moist**—water from the bottom to avoid waterlogging.  
  3. Maintain a temperature of **20–30 °C**; germination takes **7–21 days**.  
  4. Be patient—seeds may germinate at different times.  
- **Transplant:** When seedlings are large enough to handle and roots poke out of the pot, move them to a larger pot or the garden.

### 2. Propagation from a Stem  
- **Source:** Fresh stem from a fruit shop or supermarket.  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Use a sharp knife to cut a thin sliver across the bottom of the stem, exposing fresh tissue.  
  2. Place the cutting in a clean glass of **tepid water**.  
  3. Position the glass in a warm, well‑lit spot.  
  4. **Change the water daily** to keep it clean.  
  5. After a couple of weeks, roots should appear.  
  6. Pot the rooted cutting in suitable soil, ensuring it never dries out.

### 3. Propagation by Division  
- **When:** Spring.  
- **Procedure:**  
  1. Carefully lift the clump and separate it into sections, each with a healthy root system.  
  2. Trim away any dead or withered stalks and leaves.  
  3. After division, prune the plants back to **~10 cm above ground** to stimulate fresh growth.

## Cultivating Lemongrass

- **Sunlight:** Needs at least **½ day of direct sun** for vigorous growth.  
- **Watering:**  
  - **Summer:** Keep soil consistently moist.  
  - **Winter:** Reduce watering to prevent root rot.  
- **Temperature:**  
  - **Frost‑tender**—may die back below **5 °C**.  
  - In colder regions, grow in pots that can be moved indoors or to a sheltered spot during winter.  
- **Pruning:**  
  - Leaves may brown during the season; prune to **10 cm above soil** in late winter.  
  - Older clumps can be rejuvenated by division or thinning, and surplus plants can be shared with friends.

## Pests & Diseases

| Issue | Notes | Prevention / Remedy |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| **Rust (West Indian variety)** | Fungal spores on leaves | Remove affected leaves promptly; water at ground level to keep leaves dry |

## Harvesting Lemongrass

- **When:** Anytime the plant has at least **10 stems**.  
- **Frequency:** Less often in winter when growth slows.  
- **Method:**  
  - Cut stems just below soil level, or remove entire stems with roots intact.  
  - Harvesting this way encourages new growth.

## Lemongrass in the Kitchen

- **Culinary Role:** A staple in East Asian cooking, often paired with ginger.  
- **Best Part:** The **fleshy white base** of the stem—most flavorful.  
- **Preparation Steps:**  
  1. Trim off roots and green leaves, leaving **6–10 cm** of thick white stem.  
  2. Strip away 1–2 layers of fibrous outer leaves.  
  3. Smash the stem with a meat tenderiser or the flat side of a knife.  
  4. Use whole or finely chopped stems to flavor soups, sauces, stir‑fries, or curries.  
- **Green Leaves:**  
  - Subtler flavor; perfect for herbal teas.
