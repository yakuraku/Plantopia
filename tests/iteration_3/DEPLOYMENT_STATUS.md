- **Commit:** `a08cda9` - "fix: add user_id field to StartTrackingRequest schema"
- **Status:** Pushed to main, awaiting deployment

### 2. Test Reports Generated
- **Location:** `tests/iteration_3/reports/`
- **Test Date:** October 11, 2025
- **Initial Results:** 54.55% pass rate (6/11 tests)

### 3. Primary Test Report Created
- **File:** `tests/iteration_3/IT3_PRIMARY_TEST_REPORT.md`
- **Content:** Documents all passed tests and failure analysis

## üîç ISSUES IDENTIFIED & STATUS

### Issue #1: Schema Mismatch (FIXED ‚úÖ)
- **Error:** `'StartTrackingRequest' object has no attribute 'user_id'`
- **Root Cause:** Backend endpoint calls `request.user_id` but schema didn't define it
- **Fix Applied:** Added `user_id` field to schema
- **Impact:** Should fix 4 test failures:
  - Plant Tracking: Start Plant Tracking - Success
  - Plant Tracking: Start Plant Tracking - Invalid Plant ID
  - Workflow: New User Complete Journey - Start Tracking
  - Workflow: Progress Tracking Through Stages - Start Tracking

### Issue #2: Missing Test User (PENDING ‚è≥)
- **Error:** `Foreign key constraint violation - user_id=1 not present in table "users"`
- **Root Cause:** Test user doesn't exist in production database
- **Impact:** 1 test failure:
  - Plant Chat: Start General Chat - Success
- **Fix Options:**
  1. Create test user (user_id=1) in production database
  2. Update tests to use an existing valid user_id
  3. Add user creation to test setup

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Monitor Deployment (NOW)
```bash
# Check GitHub Actions deployment status
# URL: https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/actions
```

### Step 2: Re-run Tests After Deployment
```bash
# SSH to GCP VM
ssh ykur@YOUR_VM_IP

# Run test suite
sudo bash /opt/plantopia/Plantopia/tests/iteration_3/run_tests_on_vm.sh

# Expected: 10/11 tests should pass (90.91%)
```

### Step 3: Address Missing Test User
**Option A - Create Test User:**
```sql
-- Connect to PostgreSQL
INSERT INTO users (id, email, name, suburb_id)
VALUES (1, 'test@plantopia.com', 'Test User', 1);
```

**Option B - Use Existing User:**
```bash
# Find existing user
SELECT id, email, name FROM users LIMIT 5;

# Update test files to use existing user_id
```

### Step 4: Final Test Run
```bash
# After fixing user issue, run tests again
sudo bash /opt/plantopia/Plantopia/tests/iteration_3/run_tests_on_vm.sh

# Expected: 11/11 tests pass (100%)
```

### Step 5: Update Primary Report
- Download new test reports via FileZilla
- Update `IT3_PRIMARY_TEST_REPORT.md` with complete passing results
- Share with team as proof of testing
