# Dealing with Slugs and Snails: The Gardener's Scourge

============================

*30 August 2025*

Few pests cause quite so much anguish to gardeners as slugs and snails. Their damage is swift and decisive, often wiping out an entire row of seedlings in a single night.  
But you don’t have to rely on the dreaded snail pellets that can harm harmless wildlife. First, let’s get to know exactly what we’re up against.

## Knowing Your Enemy

Both slugs and snails belong to the **gastropod mollusc** class, yet they’re not closely related and there are countless species within each group.  
- **Snails** carry a shell; **slugs** are shell‑less.  
- Size and colour vary widely in both families.  
- Their behaviours and control methods are similar enough that we can treat them as a single garden pest category.

## The Damage They Cause

It’s easier to list the plants that *avoid* slug and snail attention than to name every vulnerable one. They tend to ignore:

- Highly aromatic herbs like **lavender**  
- Hairy‑stemmed flowers such as **geraniums**  
- Euphorbias (when possible)  
- Ferns  

Beyond these, virtually any tender, young plant—and many older ones—will be on the menu.

## Control Methods

There’s no fool‑proof way to eliminate slugs and snails, but many gardeners enjoy the challenge of finding new, creative deterrents. Below are **eight** of the most common methods that work to varying degrees.

1. **Remove Hiding Places**  
   * Slugs and snails thrive in dark, damp corners filled with rotting organic matter.  
   * Keep the area around your beds clean and tidy to divert them elsewhere.

2. **Encourage Birds**  
   * Install bird feeders and baths; keep them filled.  
   * Birds will swoop in for an easy meal and may take a few slugs/snails as dessert.

3. **Raise Chickens or Ducks**  
   * If avian help isn’t enough, poultry can be a tasty snack for these molluscs.  
   * *Caution:* let’s keep them from becoming a new source of garden damage.

4. **Nocturnal Collection**  
   * Pick up any slugs/snails you spot during daytime chores.  
   * Options:  
     - Transfer them to a bucket and move them far from the garden.  
     - For the less squeamish, a quick snip with scissors or a stamp with a heavy boot works.  
   * For a real impact, patrol at night with a torch to surprise them on the move.  
   * Focus on beds with fresh seedlings and recently watered areas.

5. **Set Traps**  
   * **Fruit peel trap** – place halves of orange or grapefruit peel, cut side down, around problem spots. Slugs are attracted to the scent and will slip inside.  
   * **Beer trap** – bury a deep saucer so it’s level with the soil, add 1–2 cm of beer. The yeasty smell lures them in; a splash prevents escape.  
     - Advanced versions with covers keep rain out and slugs in.  
     - Remember to empty the trap regularly—warm weather makes it increasingly unpleasant.

6. **Barrier Methods**  
   * Even with diligent control, some gastropods will remain. Use barriers to protect individual plants.

   - **Copper** – a band or ring around the soil base delivers a mild electric shock to crossing slugs. For containers, copper tape works similarly.  
     *Note:* if a plant bends to the ground, the copper protection is lost.  

   - **Grit, Sand, or Egg Shells** – sprinkle rough grit, sharp sand, or crumbled eggshells around plant bases. The discomfort may deter them, though success varies.  

   - **Diatomaceous Earth** – an organic product made from fossilised seashells, it’s microscopically sharp. Spread it around plants for a highly effective deterrent against slugs, snails, and even earwigs.

7. **Nematodes**  
   * Treat the garden with dormant parasitic nematodes via the watering can.  
   * They attack specific pests, often with impressive results.  
   * Drawbacks:  
     - Nematodes are highly specific; you may need different products for each slug/snail species.  
     - Treating large areas can be expensive, and repeated applications throughout the year add up.

8. **Slug Pellets**  
   * As a last resort, spread modern organic pellets based on ferric phosphate.  
   * Avoid less selective poisons like metaldehyde, which can harm innocent wildlife.

> *With each of these methods, some gardeners see great success while others notice little change. Because slugs and snails are such a persistent problem, it’s wise to mix several tactics into your routine.*
