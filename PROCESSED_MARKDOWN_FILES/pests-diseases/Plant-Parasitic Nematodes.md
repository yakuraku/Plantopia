# Plant‑Parasitic Nematodes

30 August 2025  
*Plant‑Parasitic Nematodes*  

Nematodes are a broad class of tiny, worm‑like creatures that live in most soils. While some species are beneficial, others can wreak havoc on your garden.

## The Threat of Non‑Beneficial Nematodes

**Plant‑parasitic nematodes** feed directly on living plants, often with catastrophic results.  
- **Piercing species** drill into roots, draining nutrients and creating entry points for fungi, bacteria, and other pathogens.  
- **Invasive species** hatch from eggs in the soil, tunnel into roots, and feed from within for life.  

These attacks weaken plants, and when larvae break into roots, they form hard knots or galls—hence the nickname *Root Knot Nematode*.  
- The knots block water and nutrient absorption.  
- Heavy infestations can **kill** the plant or severely stunt its growth.

## Spotting a Nematode Problem

Because most parasitic nematodes are microscopic, you’ll usually notice their damage through plant symptoms:

| Symptom | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| Wilting, yellowing, stunted growth | Roots can’t absorb water or nutrients |
| Reduced yields or no fruit | Roots are too damaged to support fruiting |
| Single plants affected while neighbors look fine | Nematodes are localized, not a general deficiency |

**Commonly affected crops:** tomatoes, peppers, corn, salad greens, soft herbs, and root vegetables (radish, potato, carrot).  

**How to check:**  
1. Gently lift a suspect plant.  
2. Inspect roots for lesions, galls, or deformed growth.  
3. Look for excessive root branching or distortion, especially in root veggies.  

*Note:* Some above‑ground nematodes twist leaves, stems, or flowers in chrysanthemums, onions, alfalfa, etc.  

The only foolproof way to confirm an infestation is a soil test from a commercial lab—often a hassle for home gardeners, but worth it if you’re unsure.

## Prevention & Control

Act quickly—nematodes spread slowly but steadily, and complete removal is tough. While nematicides exist, they’re toxic and not always effective for home gardens. Instead, try these practical, low‑impact methods:

### 1. Keep Soil Well‑Drained  
- Excess moisture lets nematodes move between roots.  
- Completely dry soil puts them into dormancy, but they’ll re‑activate when moisture returns.

### 2. Rotate Crops  
- Different nematodes prefer different hosts.  
- Moving a crop just a meter or two can interrupt breeding cycles without a full garden overhaul.

### 3. Biofumigation  
- Mustard family plants (e.g., *Brassica* spp.) contain glucosinolates—sulphurous compounds that deter pests.  
- Grow them as green manure or cover crops, then shred and incorporate into soil.  
- As the matter decomposes, it releases natural nematode‑killing chemicals.

### 4. French Marigolds (*Tagetes patula*)  
- Roots release compounds that suppress nematode egg hatching.  
- Plant as a cover crop 2–3 months before sowing vegetables to break the nematode life cycle.

### 5. Choose Resistant Varieties  
- Many vegetables have nematode‑resistant cultivars.  
- Plant these for a season or two to reduce the population before switching back.

### 6. Grow Early Croppers  
- Nematode activity peaks in late summer.  
- Early‑maturing varieties often finish before damage becomes severe.

### 7. Maintain Healthy Soil  
- Enrich with organic matter to strengthen plants and encourage natural predators.  
- A robust root system can tolerate milder attacks.

### 8. Remove Infected Roots  
- After an infestation, dig up and discard all roots—nematodes can survive dormant in them.

### 9. Screen Incoming Plants  
- Inspect seedlings and other additions for root deformation.  
- Dispose of any suspect plants to prevent re‑introduction.

### 10. Solarise Infested Areas  
- For severe cases, solarisation kills many soil organisms, including nematodes.  
  1. Remove all plants from the target area.  
  2. Level the soil, water thoroughly, and cover with clear plastic.  
  3. Leave for at least one month in high summer.  
  4. The heat will kill organisms in the top 10 cm of soil.

## Bottom Line

Nematodes—both helpful and harmful—are a natural part of most soils. When parasitic populations spiral out of control, they can cripple your garden. By spotting early signs and applying these practical control methods, you’ll protect your plants today and build a healthier, more resilient garden for tomorrow.
