*Dealing with Slugs and Snails in an Organic Garden*

Slugs and snails are a natural part of many garden ecosystems, but when their numbers grow, they can wreak havoc—especially on tender seedlings. Below are practical, organic-friendly tactics to keep them in check.

## **Short Term Control**

- **Night‑time hand removal**  
  *Slugs and snails are most active after dark.*  
  Grab a torch, head out, and pick them off by hand.  
  *Tip:* Removing them all at once can create a vacuum that fuels a population boom, so this is a temporary fix rather than a long‑term solution.

- **Protect seedlings**  
  - Wrap young plants in *cloches* made from cut‑off plastic drink bottles.  
  - Fit larger plants with collars fashioned from the same bottles.

- **Physical barriers**  
  - **Copper tape or wire**: Encircle beds with vulnerable seedlings.  
  - **Crushed, cleaned, dried eggshells**: Works best in dry conditions when the shells are sharp.  
  - **Wood ash**: Acts as a barrier in dry weather but can raise soil pH; use sparingly.  
  - **Sheep’s wool**: Some gardeners swear by it as a deterrent—try a small bundle around the base of the plant.

## **Traps For Slugs and Snails**

When the population is out of balance, trapping becomes essential.

- **Beer bottle trap**  
  1. Half‑bury a plastic bottle in the soil.  
  2. Cut two holes in the side.  
  3. Fill it halfway with beer.  
  4. Insert a stick to let non‑target creatures escape.  
  Slugs are attracted, get “drunk,” and drown.

- **Spot the hideouts**  
  Inspect damp, moist areas—under mulch, near compost piles, or in shady corners. These are prime gathering spots and give you a sense of the infestation level.

## **Plants To Repel Slugs and Snails**

- **Chives** – place or tie around vulnerable plants.  
- **Rosemary** – its strong scent keeps slugs at bay.  
- **Anise** – works well as a companion plant.  
- **Fennel** – another aromatic deterrent.

## **Attracting Predators To Eat Slugs and Snails**

The most sustainable control method is to invite natural predators into your garden.

| Predator | How to Encourage |
|----------|------------------|
| **Birds** | Install feeders, provide nesting boxes, and keep a water source. |
| **Lizards & Reptiles** | Maintain a sunny, dry spot with rocks and leaf litter. |
| **Frogs & Toads** | Create a small pond or keep a damp area. |
| **Small Mammals** | Offer a small shelter; they’ll forage for slugs. |
| **Chickens** | Let them roam near the beds—watch for seedling damage.  *Tip:* Drop captured slugs into their coop, but remember to **worm** the chickens regularly. |
| **Ducks & Geese** | These waterfowl love snails; a pond can attract them. |

By combining these short‑term tactics with a balanced ecosystem that supports natural predators, you’ll keep slugs and snails from becoming a major nuisance while staying true to organic gardening principles.
