# Possum Problems? How to Deter Them Without Causing Harm
=========================================================
30 August 2025

A wide diversity of wildlife is usually a good thing in a garden. From birds to bugs and even amphibians, a thriving eco‑system signals underlying health and sustainable practices.

But not all visitors are equally welcome. While possums may have a certain charm, their nocturnal adventures can quickly drive a gardener to distraction. If you’ve noticed fresh, juicy damage to seedlings, flower buds, or fruit, you’re probably dealing with these marsupial foragers.

## Possum Eating Habits
- **Fresh, tender growth is their favourite**: flower buds, vegetable seedlings, and young shoots are prime targets.
- **Accomplished climbers**: they love tree fruits and often feast high up in the branches.
- **More than just plant damage**: in their search they can overturn rubbish bins, topple compost heaps, and knock over container gardens.
- **Messy aftermath**: copious droppings can leave a tidy‑minded gardener’s work in tatters.

Despite the nuisance, possums are protected under the *Wildlife Act of 1975*. Any deterrent that harms them is both illegal and unethical. So how do you keep them out without causing harm?

## Immediate Protection
Use their natural aversion to ageing, tough or prickly plants to your advantage.

- **Create a spiky barrier**: scatter old rose cuttings or similar sharp materials across the soil.  
- **Spiky mini‑forest**: poke twigs and canes into the ground to form a deterrent.
- **Bird‑proof netting**: choose a strong net that resists gnawing teeth.  
  - *Tip*: netting doesn’t have to be permanent. Attach it at dusk for overnight protection, then remove it in the morning to allow watering, weeding, and harvesting.
- **Tree fruit protection**: use string or a plastic tie to attach an exclusion bag around ripening fruit, offering both protection and concealment.

## Deterring with Strong Odours
Possums dislike strong scents. While commercial chemicals may not appeal to organic gardeners, you can harness natural aromas safely.

### Homemade Garlic Spray
1. **Steep**: 2 Tbsp chopped garlic in 2 L boiling water.  
2. **Cool** overnight, then strain.  
3. **Spray** liberally on plants that attract possums.  
4. **Reapply** after rain or when the scent fades.

### Up the Ante
If garlic loses its bite, try:

- **Chili spray**: replace garlic with chopped fiery chillies.  
- **Quassia** (a bark used in commercial organic products):  
  1. Boil 100 g quassia chips in 2 L water for 1 h.  
  2. Dilute to a quarter‑strength.  
  3. Add 1–2 Tbsp horticultural soap to help the mixture stick.  
  4. Spray where needed.

### Other Odorous Sprays (try or skip)
- Fish oil or fish sauce  
- Hot English mustard  
- Tabasco sauce  
- Strongly brewed tea (Earl Grey or Lapsang Souchong)

## Making Access Difficult
Long‑term success comes from physically limiting entry points.

- **Wire mesh perimeter**: choose a loose mesh rather than solid fencing. Possums prefer stable structures; a wobbly mesh is more deterrent.
- **Perfumed plant hedges**: lavender, rosemary, or citronella create natural barriers.  
  - *Enhance* with a heavy mulch of blood‑and‑bone fertiliser around the base—its rotting scent repels possums.
- **Climbing deterrents**:  
  - Clear plastic bands around tree trunks  
  - Spikes or rollers on fence tops and walls  
  - Netting between trees and structures  
  - Motion‑detecting security lighting (midnight fright)  
  - Sonic deterrent devices (beware of pets and sensitive ears)  
  - Fill in burrows, tree hollows, and other resting places once confirmed unoccupied.

## Other Physical Deterrents
If possums still treat your garden as a playground, add obstacles:

- **Clear plastic bands** around trunks  
- **Spikes or rollers** on fences and walls  
- **Netting** between trees and structures  
- **Motion‑detecting lights**  
- **Sonic devices** (use cautiously)  
- **Burrow removal** (possums are opportunists, not burrowers)

## Final Thoughts
Possums can wreak havoc, but realistic gardeners know that a battle you can’t win is better fought with humane, practical measures. By making life difficult for them—without causing harm—you keep damage to a minimum and preserve the ecological diversity that a thriving possum population represents.
