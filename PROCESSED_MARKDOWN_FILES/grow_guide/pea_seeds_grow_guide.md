## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Peas thrive in *full sun*—pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours** of direct light each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen, and enrich with **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **pH (Optional):**  
  - Peas prefer an **alkaline** soil (pH ≥ 7).  
  - If your soil is below 7, apply **dolomite** (Ca‑Mg carbonate) or **garden lime** (Ca carbonate) at the recommended rate, then water well before sowing.  
  - *Lime* boosts nutrient availability for many plants.

## How to Sow Pea Seeds

1. **Direct sow**:  
   - Plant seeds **20 mm deep** and **20 cm apart** within a row.  
   - Space rows **100 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil consistently **moist**—never waterlogged or dry.  
3. **Germination:**  
   - Seeds sprout in **7–21 days** when soil temperature is **15–20 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

## How to Grow Peas

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface; water when it feels dry.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- **Fertilizing (if needed):**  
  - *Well‑prepared soil* usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
  - In poorer soils or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertilizer** at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - **Liquid fertilizer** during fruiting or flowering, following label instructions.  
- **Support for climbing varieties:**  
  - Stake or trellis early—use sturdy stakes, a trellis, or a tripod.  
  - Tie stems gently with twine or plant ties as they grow.  
  - Set up support **before** sowing or transplanting to avoid root disturbance.

## How to Harvest Peas

- **Timing:** Peas are ready in **60–80 days**.  
- **Variety‑specific cues:**  
  - *Snow peas & sugar snap peas:* Harvest when pods are **large enough to eat**.  
  - *Shelling peas:* Harvest when pods are **full, plump, and crisp**.  
- **Technique:**  
  - Cut pods with snips or secateurs.  
  - Harvest regularly to encourage more pods.  
  - For shelling peas, break open pods, remove peas, and discard the shells.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Store whole pods or shelled peas in the fridge for short‑term use.  
  - For longer storage, blanch shelled peas and freeze.

## Common Problems When Growing Peas

| Problem | What to Watch For | Quick Fixes |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Armyworms, cutworms, caterpillars** | Small holes in fruit, soft fruit interior | Inspect fruit, remove caterpillars; use netting or fruit bags; spray with Dipel if needed |
| **Possums, birds, other animals** | Sudden loss of harvest | Netting or cages; homemade deterrents (garlic, fish oil, mustard spray) |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots on leaves that spread | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide or homemade spray |
| **Pea beetles (pea weevil)** | Brown‑grey beetles on leaves; eggs on pods; larvae inside seeds | Monitor in spring, use insecticide spray, discard infested seed |
| **Rust** | Brown/orange raised spots on foliage | Space plants, ensure full sun, avoid over‑fertilizing, remove dead material, rotate crops |
| **Slugs & snails** | Slimy trails, chewed leaves (mostly at night) | Remove hiding spots, free‑range poultry, torchlight collection, traps |
