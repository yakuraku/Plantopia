**Binomial name:** _Banksia sp._  
**Life Cycle:** perennial

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Banksias love *full sun*. Pick a spot that gets **at least 6 h of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Permanent spot:** They’re perennial, so choose a *long‑term location* where you won’t have to dig up the roots repeatedly.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs to be **well‑drained**.  
  - Usually you *don’t* need manure or extra fertilisers.  
  - **Weed** thoroughly, then loosen the soil by digging or turning it over.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, pick a variety that’s *recommended for container growing*.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - The pot should be **at least 75 L** to accommodate mature plants.  
  - During the growing season, container plants often need a little extra fertiliser to stay healthy.

## How to Sow Banksia Seeds

Banksia seeds are *simple to handle*—no soaking or stratification required.

1. **Set up trays or pots** with a good quality seed‑raising mix (or use soil starter pellets).  
2. **Sow** the seeds **3 mm deep**.  
3. **Moisture:** Keep the soil *moist*—never let it dry out completely or become water‑logged.  
4. **Germination:** Seeds should sprout in **21–40 days** when the soil temperature is **20–25 °C**.  
5. **Transplanting:** Move seedlings to the garden once they develop their *first true leaves* and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing:** Plant them **150 cm apart** to give each plant room to grow.

> **Tip:** Many native seeds are dormant and may take longer than expected to germinate. Be patient and follow the instructions closely.

## How to Grow Banksia

- **Watering:**  
  - Once established, Banksias are *drought tolerant*.  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings.  
  - Water only when the soil is dry **10 cm below the surface** (check by scratching a little soil with your finger).  
  - Water *deeply* in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  

- **Fertilising:**  
  - If the soil was well prepared, you usually **don’t need extra fertiliser**.  
  - In poorer soil or to give a boost, use a **low‑phosphorus** or native‑plant‑specific fertiliser:  
    - **Slow‑release**: apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid**: apply at the recommended rate and frequency while plants are fruiting or flowering.  

- **Cutting Flowers:**  
  - Harvest when about **¼ of the florets** are open on each spike.  
  - Use sharp snips or secateurs to cut branches to the desired length.  
  - Remove lower leaves and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.  
  - To dry, hang branches upside down in a dry, shaded area.  

- **Pruning:**  
  - After flowering, prune back to tidy the plant and encourage vigorous new growth.  
  - Cut stems just above a set of lower leaves with sharp tools.  

- **Maturity:** Banksias typically reach maturity in **3–10 years**.

## Common Problems When Growing Banksia

| Problem | What It Looks Like | What to Do |
|---------|--------------------|------------|
| **Grey mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Mouldy flowers, rotting fruit | Prune affected parts, water at soil level (not on leaves), spray with a suitable fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, spray with fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Root rot** | Slow establishment, yellowing or wilted foliage, soft brown tissue at stem base and roots | Remove and dispose of affected plants. Reduce soil moisture, add organic matter, keep mulch away from stems. |

> **Pro tip:** Good drainage and proper watering habits are your best defense against most of these issues.
