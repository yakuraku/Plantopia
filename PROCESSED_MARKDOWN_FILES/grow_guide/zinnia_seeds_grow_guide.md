**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** _Zinnia elegans_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

---

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Zinnias thrive in *full sun* – aim for at least **6 hours of direct light** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Choose a *well‑drained* mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen, and enrich the soil with **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
  - *Tip:* For more on soil prep, check out our detailed guide.  
- **Container Growing:**  
  - Pick a variety labeled **“container‑friendly.”**  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot that holds at least **40 L** (≈ 10 gal).  
  - Containers often need extra fertiliser during the growing season to keep plants healthy.

## How to Sow Zinnia Seeds

Zinnia seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification required.  
You can either **sow directly** in the garden or **raise seedlings** in trays and transplant later.

### 1. Sow Directly

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sprinkle seeds **6 mm** deep, spacing **15–30 cm** apart. |
| 2 | Keep the soil **moist** (never soggy or dry). |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–14 days** at **21–29 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raise Seedlings

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **6 mm** deep. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist** soil (avoid waterlogging). |
| 4 | Germinate in **7–14 days** at **21–29 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm** tall. |
| 6 | Space out plants **15–30 cm** apart. |

> **Pro tip:** Using jiffy pots or soil pellets reduces root disturbance when transplanting.

> **Frost alert:** Zinnias are frost‑sensitive. Wait until the danger of frost has passed before sowing or transplanting outdoors.

## How to Grow Zinnia

### Watering

- Keep the soil **evenly moist** but never waterlogged.  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- Avoid wetting the foliage to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- *Learn more about watering best practices.*

### Fertilising

- If the soil was well prepared, **no extra fertiliser** is usually needed.  
- In poorer soils or to give a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertiliser:  

  * **Slow‑release:** Apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  * **Liquid:** Use during flowering or fruiting, following the recommended rate and frequency.

### Support

- Zinnias can grow tall and may need support.  
- Use a **stake, bamboo cane, trellis,** or **string lines**.  
- Install support **before** sowing or transplanting to avoid disturbing roots later.

### Pruning & Pinching

- Pinch off the growing tips to encourage **denser growth**, stronger stems, and more blooms.  
- Use sharp secateurs or snips to remove the top set of leaves, cutting just above a lower leaf set.

### Flowering Time

- Expect **≈ 90 days** from sowing to first blooms.

### Cut‑Flower Tips

- For the longest stems, cut with sharp snips or secateurs.  
- Remove lower leaves and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.  
- *More on cutting and conditioning homegrown flowers.*

### Deadheading

- Regularly trim fading or dead flowers just above a leaf set.  
- This encourages continuous blooming.  
- *Learn more about deadheading.*

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Issue | Symptoms | Quick Fix |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scabs; premature leaf/flower drop. | Water at soil level, discard fallen debris, practice crop rotation. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level, remove affected leaves, avoid overcrowding; consider a homemade milk spray or fungicide if persistent. |
| **Spider Mites** | Dry, wilted, or discolored leaves; undersides feel sandpaper‑like. | Prune for airflow, spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulphur. |
| **Whitefly** | Yellowing or wilting leaves; large swarms on undersides. | Hose down or spray with soap; destroy severely affected plants; attract beneficial predators. |
