## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Full sun to part shade – aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** daily.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, loosen with a fork or tiller.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Container Growing:**  
  - Choose a variety suited for pots.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Minimum pot size: **10 L** (≈ 2.6 gal).  
  - Container plants often need a little extra fertiliser during the season.

## How to Sow Schizanthus Seeds  

Schizanthus seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification required.  
You can sow them **directly in the garden** or **raise seedlings** in trays and transplant later.

### 1. Sow Direct  

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sprinkle seeds **3 mm deep** and **30 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist but never soggy**. |
| 3 | Germination: **5–10 days** at **18–22 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raise Seedlings  

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **3 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist soil** (never water‑logged). |
| 4 | Germinate in **5–10 days** at **18–22 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **30 cm apart** in the garden. |

> **Tip:** Schizanthus is frost‑sensitive. **Never plant outdoors** until the danger of frost has passed.  
> In cooler climates, start seeds indoors **6 weeks before the last expected frost** in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Schizanthus  

### Watering  

- Check soil moisture **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  

### Fertilising  

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertiliser.  
- For poorer soil or a growth boost:  
  - **High‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertiliser.  
  - *Slow‑release:* apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - *Liquid:* apply during flowering or fruiting, following the label’s rate and frequency.  

### Support  

- As plants grow, they may need **stakes, bamboo canes, trellises, or string lines**.  
- Install support **before sowing or transplanting** to avoid disturbing roots later.  

### Pruning & Pinching  

- **Pinch** the growing tips to promote denser growth, stronger stems, and more flowers.  
- Use sharp secateurs or snips: cut just above a set of lower leaves.  

### Flowering  

- Schizanthus typically **flowers in ~120 days**.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: trim fading or dead flowers just above a leaf set to encourage more blooms.  

### Cut Flowers  

- For bouquets, cut the **longest stems** with sharp snips or secateurs.  
- Remove lower leaves and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.

## Common Problems When Growing Schizanthus  

| Pest / Disease | What It Looks Like | Management |
|----------------|--------------------|------------|
| **Aphids** (2–4 mm) | New shoots, undersides of leaves; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Grey mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Mouldy flowers, rotting fruit; thrives in cool, damp weather | Prune affected parts, water at soil level (not on leaves), apply fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Thrips** (<1.5 mm) | Small white or transparent marks on leaves and petals; may spread pathogens | Wash with a garden hose, encourage predatory mites and lacewings, or spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |
| **Whitefly** | Yellowing or wilting leaves; large swarms on leaf undersides | Hose spray, soap spray; severely affected plants may need removal. Attract beneficial insects for natural control. |
