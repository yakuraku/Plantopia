# How to Grow Thyme Seeds

**Family:** Lamiaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Thymus vulgaris_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot** – Thyme is a long‑lived perennial, so pick a location where it can stay undisturbed.  
- **Sunlight** – Aim for **at least 6 hours of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil** – Thyme loves *well‑drained* soil.  
  - No need for manure or heavy fertilisers.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area and loosen the soil with a fork or tiller.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Container growing** – If you’re using pots:  
  - Pick a variety suited to containers.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - **Minimum size:** 10 L (about 2.5 gal).  
  - Container plants may need a little extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Thyme Seeds

Thyme seeds are tiny but easy to grow with a few simple steps.

1. **Seed‑raising mix** – Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good quality seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. **Sow depth** – Sprinkle seeds **3 mm (½ inch) deep**.  
3. **Moisture** – Keep the soil *moist but never soggy or dry*.  
4. **Germination** – Seeds should sprout in **14–21 days** at a soil temperature of **18–21 °C (65–70 °F)**.  
5. **Transplanting** – Move seedlings outdoors once they have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Spacing** – Plant in the garden **25 cm (10 in) apart**.

**Tip:**  
- Thyme seeds are so small they can blow away or wash out.  
- Mix them with a little sand or fine potting mix before sowing, or use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly.  
- Press lightly into the soil surface to ensure good contact.  
- Keep the seedlings from drying out—water gently and regularly.

**Optional indoor start:**  
- In cooler climates, sow indoors **6 weeks before the last expected frost**.  
- Grow them in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Thyme

- **Watering** – Once established, thyme is drought‑tolerant.  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings.  
  - Water only when the soil is dry **10 cm (4 in) below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
  - Water deeply in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.  
- **Fertilising** –  
  - If the soil was well prepared, no extra fertiliser is needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertiliser** – apply at transplant or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
    - **Liquid fertiliser** – apply during fruiting or flowering, following the recommended rate and frequency.  
- **Pruning** – After flowering, trim back to tidy the plant and encourage vigorous new growth.  
  - Use sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - Cut stems just above a set of lower leaves.

## How to Harvest Thyme

- **Timing** – Thyme is ready to harvest in **70–90 days**.  
- **Method** – Pinch off the outer stems and leaves, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
- **Short‑term storage** – Keep leaves on stems in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
- **Long‑term options** – Dry, freeze, or preserve in oil.

## Common Problems When Growing Thyme

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention / Remedy |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow to grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides | Water at soil level, avoid wetting leaves, ensure good airflow, remove and destroy affected leaves. If persistent, use a homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium wilt** | Wilting, drying, yellowing leaves and branches; eventual death | No cure; prevent by choosing resistant varieties, disposing of infected plants and soil, practicing good garden hygiene, and rotating crops. |
