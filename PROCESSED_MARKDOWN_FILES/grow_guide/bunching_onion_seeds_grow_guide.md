# How to Grow Bunching Onion Seeds

**Family:** Amaryllidaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Allium fistulosum_  
**Life Cycle:** perennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Bunching onions thrive in **full sun** – aim for at least **6 h of direct light** each day.  
- **Soil:** Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  1. Weed the area thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  3. Mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  4. Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a variety suited for pots.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Pick a container **≥ 20 L** to give the plants room to grow.  
  - Remember: container plants often need a bit more fertiliser during the season.

## How to Sow Bunching Onion Seeds

Bunching onion seeds are **easy to handle** – no soaking or stratification required.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep** and **3 cm apart** in rows **30 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep the soil **moist but not soggy**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–10 days** at **15–25 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist** soil (never wet or dry). |
| 4 | Germinate in **7–10 days** at **15–25 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space transplanted plants **3 cm apart** in rows **30 cm apart**. |

> **Tip:** Bunching onions bolt in hot weather. Avoid sowing or transplanting when temperatures are high.

> **Tip:** For a quick “scatter seed” method, roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover them.  

> **Tip:** Because the seeds are tiny, mix them with sand or fine potting mix before sowing, or use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly. Press lightly into the soil to ensure good contact.

## How to Grow Bunching Onion

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil feels **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (check by scratching a bit of soil).  
  - Water **deeply** in the **early morning** or **late afternoon**.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  

- **Fertilising:**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, **no extra fertiliser** is needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑nitrogen** or leafy‑green‑specific fertiliser:  
    - **Slow‑release**: apply at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid**: apply at the recommended rate and frequency during the season.  

- **Thinning (Optional):**  
  - When seedlings are large enough to handle, pull out weaker ones so that plants are spaced **≈ 3 cm apart**.

## How to Harvest Bunching Onions

- **Timing:** Ready to harvest in **60–90 days**.  
- **Method:**  
  1. Pull individual plants from the ground.  
  2. Shake off excess soil.  
  3. For a “cut‑and‑come‑again” crop, cut leaves at ground level; new leaves will grow from the base.  
- **Storage:** Freshly harvested leaves or whole plants can be kept in the fridge for short‑term use.

## Common Problems & How to Handle Them

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Why It Happens | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may leave honeydew attracting ants. | Warm, dry conditions. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set. | Extreme heat or sudden temperature shifts. | Sow after frost danger, keep plants well‑watered and shaded during heat spikes. |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._) | Brown to orange raised spots or patches on foliage. | 10–20 °C with high humidity; wind or water spreads spores. | Space plants to avoid overcrowding, provide full sun, avoid over‑fertilising, remove dead material, practice crop rotation. |
| **Onion Thrips** (_Thrips tabaci_) | Silver patches on leaves; may reduce yield. | Thrips feed on sap, often hiding in leaf folds. | Wash with a garden hose, mulch around plants, encourage predatory mites and lacewings with companion planting. |
