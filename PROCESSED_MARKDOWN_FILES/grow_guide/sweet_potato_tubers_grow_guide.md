# How to Grow Sweet Potato Tubers

**Family:** Convolvulaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Ipomoea batatas_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Sweet potatoes thrive in **full sun** or **partial shade**. Pick a spot that gets at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:** Use a **loose, well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Weeding: Remove all weeds before planting.  
  - Tilling: Dig to a **spade‑deep** level to loosen the soil.  
  - Amendments: Add **aged animal manure** or **compost** to lighten heavy soils and give roots room to grow.  
- **Weed control:** Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.

## Growing Sweet Potato

Sweet potato cultivation is a two‑step process:  
1. **Grow shoots** from the tuber.  
2. **Plant and care** for the resulting cuttings.

### Shoots can be grown in two ways: soil or water.

#### Soil Method

1. Fill a seedling tray or a **20 cm pot** with **free‑draining potting mix** (moist but not wet).  
2. Lay the tuber **horizontally** on the mix and **half‑bury** it.  
3. Place the container in a **warm, well‑lit** spot. A heat mat can speed shoot formation.  
4. Keep the soil consistently moist.  
5. When shoots reach **15–20 cm**, use a clean, sharp knife to cut them off the tuber or twist them off at the base.

#### Water Method

1. Fill a clean glass or jar with tap water.  
2. Identify the **root end** (narrow, tapered, may show roots) and the **sprouting end** (small eyes).  
3. Insert toothpicks about halfway along the tuber to suspend it; the root end should be **submerged**.  
4. Place the jar in a **warm, well‑lit** area. Replace the water **weekly** or as needed.  
5. Roots grow first, followed by shoots.  
6. When shoots reach **15–20 cm**, cut them off with a clean, sharp knife.

*Cuttings can be planted directly in the garden or placed in a jar of water to develop roots. To learn how to root cuttings in water, click here.*

### How to Plant Sweet Potato Cuttings

- **Timing:** Wait until **all danger of frost** has passed.  
- **Leaf removal:** Trim the bottom set of leaves, leaving only the top set.  
- **Planting depth:** Dig a **7–10 cm deep** hole and plant the cutting **horizontally**. Ensure at least one **leaf node** is buried.  
- **Cover:** Fill in with soil and water well.  
- **Spacing:** Place cuttings **30 cm apart** in rows spaced **75 cm apart**.

### Watering

- **When to water:** Check the soil 5 cm below the surface; if it feels dry, water.  
- **Method:** Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid leaf wetness:** Keep water off the foliage to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilizing

- If the soil was well prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is needed.  
- Over‑fertilizing can lead to lush foliage at the expense of tuber development.  
- In poor soil, use a **low‑nitrogen, high‑phosphorus** fertilizer (e.g., blood and bone) at the recommended rate.

## How to Harvest Sweet Potato

- **Harvest time:** Roughly **120 days** after planting.  
- **Signs of readiness:** Leaves begin to **turn yellow**.  
- **Method:**  
  - Use a garden fork to gently lift the tubers, taking care not to damage them.  
  - Shake off excess soil.  
  - Alternatively, “bandicoot” the tubers by carefully digging a few at a time.  
- **Curing:** Place harvested tubers in a **warm, dry** area for **10–14 days**.  
- **Storage:** Keep in a **dark, cool, well‑ventilated** space, checking regularly for rot.  
- **Winter care:** In warm climates, tubers can stay in the ground over winter. In cold climates, take slips or cuttings in late autumn, grow indoors or under cover, and replant in spring.

## Common Problems When Growing Sweet Potato

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention & Management |
|---------|----------|------------------------|
| **Rotten tubers** | Tubers show rot, lack roots/shoots, or produce stunted yellow leaves. | Plant in **free‑draining soil**, raised beds, or containers. **Do not water** until shoots emerge. In heavy soils, lift and store tubers over winter, replant in spring. |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium wilt** | Roots infected; leaves and branches wilt, dry, and die; leaves may yellow. | No cure; choose **resistant varieties**, dispose of affected plants and soil, practice good hygiene, and rotate crops. |
| **Frost damage** | Leaves wilt and turn black. | Do not plant seedlings until all frost danger has passed. Harvest before winter. Prune frost‑damaged leaves to prevent rot. |
