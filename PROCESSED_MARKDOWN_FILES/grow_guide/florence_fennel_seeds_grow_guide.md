  - **Weed** thoroughly, dig to loosen, and mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you prefer pots, pick a variety labeled for container growth.

## 2. Sowing Florence Fennel Seeds

| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Seed treatment** | No soaking or stratification needed. |
| **Planting depth** | 8 mm deep. |
| **Spacing** | 40 cm between plants, 60 cm between rows. |
| **Soil moisture** | Keep **moist but never water‑logged**. |
| **Germination** | 7–14 days at 10–30 °C. |
| **Protection** | Shield seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

## 3. Growing & Care

### Watering
- Water when the top 5 cm of soil feels dry (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
- **Deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering is best.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising
- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertiliser.  
- If soil is poor or you want a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release fertiliser** at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
  - **Liquid fertiliser** during fruiting or flowering, following the product’s recommended rate and frequency.

## 4. Harvesting

| Stage | When & How |
|-------|------------|
| **Leaves** | Ready after 80–100 days. Pinch off outer leaves, leaving some for regrowth. Consume fresh or store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge. |
| **Bulbs** | Harvest when ~8 cm across. Cut the plant at soil level, trim stems and leaves 3–5 cm above the bulb. Store in a perforated bag in the fridge or preserve by pickling/blanching and freezing. |
| **Seeds** | Collect when flower heads dry and turn brown, before seeds fall. Cut heads, place in a paper bag, keep cool and dry for a couple of weeks until fully dry. Shake out seeds, remove chaff, and store in an airtight container at room temperature. |

## 5. Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Symptoms | Management |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap/alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set. | Avoid sowing before frost danger passes; keep plants well‑watered in hot weather to reduce heat stress. |
| **Bulbs Not Forming** | No bulb development. | Ensure correct variety, sow at the right time, maintain consistent moisture, avoid hot conditions. |
| **Cutworms** | Moth larvae (3–4 cm) chew stems at night, killing seedlings. | Hand‑pick at night or use cardboard collars around stems. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding places, use free‑range poultry, collect by torchlight, or set traps. |
