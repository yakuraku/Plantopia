## 1. Preparation

### Sunlight  
- **Full sun is a must** – pick a spot that receives **at least 6 hours of direct sunlight** each day.

### Soil  
- **Loose, well‑drained** soil enriched with organic matter is ideal.  
- **Steps to prepare:**
  1. **Weed** the area thoroughly.  
  2. **Dig** to a spade’s depth (≈30 cm) to loosen the soil.  
  3. Mix in **aged animal manure or compost** to lighten heavy soils and boost fertility.  
  4. Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.

> *Tip:* Adding organic matter to heavy clay can dramatically improve root growth.

### Containers  
- Saffron crocuses grow well in pots.  
- Choose a container **recommended for container growing** and **at least 20 L** in volume.  
- Use a high‑quality potting mix and remember that container plants may need **extra fertiliser** during the growing season.

## 2. Planting the Corms

- **Plant directly in the garden or in a container.**  
- **Spacing & depth:**
  - Place bulbs **10–15 cm apart**.  
  - Dig **10 cm deep** with the pointed tip facing **upwards**.  
- **Cover** with soil, then **water well**.  
- Keep the soil **moist but not waterlogged** until shoots appear.

## 3. Growing & Care

### Watering  
- Water when the soil is **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (check by finger).  
- **Deep, early‑morning or late‑afternoon** watering is best.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising  
- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertiliser.  
- If soil is poor or you want a boost, use a **high‑potassium or flowering‑plant fertiliser**:
  - **Slow‑release**: apply at the recommended rate when shoots emerge.  
  - **Liquid**: apply at the recommended rate and frequency when shoots emerge.  
- After flowering, fertilise with **blood & bone** or **aged/pelletised chicken manure**, then water well.

### Deadheading & Foliage Management  
- **Regularly remove** spent flowers with sharp secateurs or snips to redirect energy to the bulb.  
- Let the foliage **die back naturally** after flowering; the plant reabsorbs nutrients for next season.  
- Once all leaves are brown, cut them at ground level with sharp tools.

### Longevity & Mulching  
- Bulbs can stay in the ground for **several years** without lifting.  
- **Heavy mulch** protects bulbs from scorching summer heat.  
- Lift bulbs only if:
  - The area has wet summers.  
  - Bulbs become overcrowded.  
  - You wish to relocate them.

## 4. Lifting & Storing Bulbs

1. **Use a garden fork** to gently lift bulbs, avoiding damage.  
2. **Prune** any dead leaves still attached.  
3. **Store** in a cool, dry place on a wire rack or a netted bag (good airflow).  
4. **Ideal storage temperature:** ~20 °C.  
5. **Avoid** temperatures above 30 °C, which can reduce viability.  
6. Re‑plant the following season following the planting chart above.

## 5. Harvesting Saffron

- **Flowers emerge at night**; harvest in the **bud stage** early the next morning or when they just open.  
- **Peel back petals** and **remove the three red stigmas** (the “threads”).  
- Pinch off the stigmas at the base with fingers or tweezers.

### Drying & Storage  
- **Fresh** or **dried** for long‑term use.  
- **Drying methods:**
  - Dehydrator  
  - Oven at 75 °C for a short time  
  - Air‑dry on paper towel for 3–5 days  
- Store dried threads in an **airtight jar**.  
- **Rehydrate** dried threads for a few minutes before use.

## 6. Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Symptoms | Management |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose<br>• Use soap or alcohol spray<br>• Encourage predatory insects |
| **Rotten bulbs/corms** | Rot, no roots or shoots, stunted yellow leaves, no flowers. | • Plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers<br>• Do not water while dormant<br>• Lift and store if climate requires |
| **Slugs & snails** | Feed on tender leaves/shoots, leave slimy trails. | • Remove hiding places<br>• Keep free‑range poultry<br>• Use traps or torchlight collection |

> *Pro tip:* Regular inspection during the growing season can catch pests early and prevent major damage.
