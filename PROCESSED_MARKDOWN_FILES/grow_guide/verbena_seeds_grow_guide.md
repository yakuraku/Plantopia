# How to Grow Verbena Seeds

**Family:** Verbenaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Verbena sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Choose a permanent spot** – Verbena is a perennial, so pick a location where it can stay undisturbed for years.  
- **Self‑seeding note** – Verbena often drops seeds at season’s end. If you *don’t* want it to spread, deadhead before seed drop or grow in containers.  
- **Sunlight** – Full sun or part shade; aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil** – Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  1. Weed thoroughly.  
  2. Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  3. Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  4. Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Container growing** – If you’re using pots, choose a variety suited to containers, use a high‑quality potting mix, and ensure the pot is **≥ 10 L**. Container plants may need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Verbena Seeds

Verbena seeds need no pre‑treatment (no soaking, stratification, etc.). You can sow them directly in the garden or raise seedlings first.

### Sow Directly

1. **Depth & spacing** – 6 mm deep, 30 cm apart.  
2. **Moisture** – Keep soil consistently moist, but never waterlogged or dry.  
3. **Germination** – 20–25 days at 21–24 °C.  
4. **Protection** – Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raise Seedlings

1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets.  
2. Sow 6 mm deep.  
3. Maintain moist soil (never wet or dry).  
4. Germination: 20–25 days at 21–24 °C.  
5. Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are 5–10 cm tall.  
6. Plant out 30 cm apart.

> **Tip:** Some varieties germinate slowly. Stick to the recommended depth and temperature, and be patient.

## How to Grow Verbena

- **Watering**  
  - Verbena is drought‑tolerant once established.  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings; check by scratching 10 cm below the surface.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to prevent fungal diseases.

- **Fertilising**  
  - If soil is already well‑prepared, no extra fertiliser is needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - *Slow‑release* fertiliser at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - *Liquid* fertiliser during flowering or fruiting, following the recommended rate and frequency.

- **Pruning & Pinching**  
  - Pinch off the top set of leaves just above a lower leaf set to encourage denser growth, stronger stems, and more flowers.  
  - **Flowering time:** ~70 days.

- **Deadheading**  
  - Regularly trim faded or dead flowers just above a leaf set to promote continuous blooming.

- **Perennial care**  
  - After flowering, cut stems to ground level and prune all dead foliage in winter.

## Common Problems When Growing Verbena

| Problem | What to Look For | Quick Fixes |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; honeydew and ants | Spray with water, soap/alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects |
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Brown, wet‑looking spots that dry to scab‑like patches; premature leaf/flower drop | Water at soil level, remove fallen debris, practice crop rotation |
| **Grey mould (Botrytis)** | Mouldy flowers/fruit; spores spread by wind | Prune affected parts, water at soil level, use fungicide or homemade spray if needed |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots spreading across leaves | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide or homemade spray |
| **Slugs & snails** | Tender leaf damage, slimy trails (nighttime) | Remove hiding spots, use poultry, torchlight traps, or physical barriers |
| **Spider mites** | Dry, wilted, or discoloured leaves; fine sandpaper feel on undersides | Prune for airflow, spray eco‑oil or wettable sulphur |

> **Pro tip:** Good air circulation and proper watering habits are your first line of defense against most fungal issues.
