# How to Grow Daffodil Bulbs

**Family:** Amaryllidaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Narcissus pseudonarcissus_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Daffodils thrive in **full sun** or **partial shade**. Aim for at least **3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:** Use a **loose, well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - *Weed* thoroughly.  
  - Dig to **spade depth** (≈ 30 cm) to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost** to lighten heavy soils and feed roots.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:** If you’re growing in pots, choose a variety suited for container use.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Minimum pot size: **10 L** (≈ 2.5 gal).  
  - Container plants may need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Plant Daffodil Bulbs

1. **Spacing & depth**  
   - Plant bulbs **10–15 cm apart**.  
   - Dig holes **10–15 cm deep**.  
   - Place the **pointed tip upward**.  
2. **Cover & water**  
   - Fill with soil and water well.  
   - Keep the soil **moist but not soggy** until shoots appear.

## How to Grow Daffodils

- **Watering**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface; water when dry.  
  - Water **deeply** in the **early morning** or **late afternoon**.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilising**  
  - If soil is well‑prepared, no extra fertiliser is needed.  
  - For poorer soil or a boost:  
    - *Slow‑release* high‑potassium or flowering‑plant fertiliser at the first shoot emergence.  
    - Or *liquid* fertiliser at the same time.  
  - After flowering, apply **blood & bone** or **aged/pelletised chicken manure** and water in well.  
- **Bloom Time**  
  - Daffodils usually flower **90–180 days** after planting.

## Deadheading & Foliage Care

- **Deadhead** regularly with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - Cut flowers with the longest stems for picking, or snap off dead blooms.  
  - Removing spent flowers redirects energy back to the bulb.  
- **Foliage**  
  - Let leaves **die down naturally** after flowering.  
  - The bulb reabsorbs nutrients from the leaves for next season’s blooms.  
  - Once all foliage has browned, trim individual leaves at ground level with sharp tools.

## Long‑Term Bulb Management

- Daffodil bulbs can stay in the ground for **years** without lifting.  
- **Mulch heavily** in hot summer areas to protect bulbs.  
- In wet summers or when overcrowded, consider lifting and relocating bulbs.

### Lifting Bulbs

1. Use a **garden fork** to gently lift bulbs, avoiding damage.  
2. Prune any **dead leaves** still attached.  
3. Store in a **cool, dry** place on a wire rack or a netting bag.  
   - Ideal storage temperature: **≈ 20 °C**.  
   - Avoid temperatures **> 30 °C** to maintain viability.  
4. Replant the following season following the planting chart above.

## Common Problems When Growing Daffodils

| Problem | Description | Management Tips |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides. They may wilt leaves and excrete honeydew, attracting ants. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage predatory insects. |
| **Rotten bulbs/corms** | Caused by pathogens in cold, wet soil or waterlogged conditions. Symptoms: rot, no roots/shoots, stunted yellow leaves, no flowers. | • Plant in free‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers.<br>• Do not water while dormant.<br>• Lift and store if climate warrants. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Molluscs that feed on tender leaves/shoots, mainly at night, leaving slimy trails. | • Remove hiding places.<br>• Keep free‑range poultry.<br>• Use traps or torchlight collection. |
| **Thrips** | Tiny (≤ 1.5 mm) flying insects; larvae suck tissue, leaving small white or transparent marks. | • Wash plants with a garden hose.<br>• Encourage predatory mites and lacewings via companion planting.<br>• Spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |
