# How to Grow Scarlet Runner Bean Seeds

**Family:** Fabaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Phaseolus coccineus_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial (grown as an annual in cool climates)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Scarlet runner beans love **full sun** – aim for at least **6 hours of direct light** each day.  
- **Planting habit:** They can be grown as **annuals** or **short‑lived perennials** (2–5 years). If you want a perennial stand, pick a **permanent spot** that won’t be disturbed by digging or heavy foot traffic.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly **weed** the area, then **dig** to loosen the soil.  
  - Add **aged animal manure** or **compost** to boost fertility.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.

## How to Sow Scarlet Runner Bean Seeds

Scarlet runner bean seeds are **ready to plant straight away** – no soaking, stratification, or pre‑germination needed.

1. **Planting depth & spacing**  
   - Sow seeds **25 mm deep**.  
   - Space seeds **15 cm apart** within rows, and keep rows **100 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture** – keep the soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
3. **Germination** – expect **4–7 days** at a soil temperature of **16–22 °C**.  
4. **Protection** – shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  
5. **Frost caution** – do **not** transplant or sow until the danger of frost has passed.

## How to Grow Scarlet Runner Beans

### Watering

- Water when the soil feels **dry about 5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
- **Early morning** or **late afternoon** is best.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
- In poorer soils or for a boost:  
  - **Slow‑release fertilizer** at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm** tall.  
  - **Liquid fertilizer** at the recommended rate/frequency during fruiting or flowering.

### Support

- Scarlet runner beans need a **trellis or sturdy support**.  
- Tie plants gently with **twine or plant ties**.  
- **Set up the support before sowing** to avoid disturbing roots later.

### Pruning & Overwintering

- In cold weather, beans may **die back**.  
- **Cut back** to just above ground in late autumn, or prune dead foliage when new growth appears in spring.  
- To overwinter in cold climates, apply a **thick layer of organic mulch** (e.g., sugar‑cane mulch) to protect from frost.

## How to Harvest Scarlet Runner Beans

- Pods are ready in **70–90 days**.  
- **Fresh harvest:**  
  - Pick pods when they’re **firm** and large enough to eat.  
  - Cut with snips or scissors.  
  - Harvest **regularly** to encourage more pods.  
  - Store in a **perforated plastic bag** in the fridge for short‑term use.  
  - For longer storage, remove beans from pods, blanch, or freeze.  
- **Dried beans:**  
  - Leave pods on the plant until they **dry** and start to split.  
  - Cut pods with snips, spread them in a single layer on a tray or rack for **two weeks** to ensure full drying.  
  - Remove seeds, store in an airtight container, and optionally add a tablespoon of rice, a paper towel, or a silicone pouch to absorb moisture.

## Common Problems When Growing Scarlet Runner Beans

| Problem | Symptoms | Management |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap/alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Tough Pods** | Pods become hard if harvested too late. | Harvest when pods are **firm and tender**; early harvesting encourages more pods. |
| **Armyworms / Cutworms / Caterpillars** | Inside fruit damage; small holes on fruit skin. | Inspect fruit, remove caterpillars, use netting or fruit bags, or spray with Dipel. |
| **Bacterial Leaf Spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scabs; premature leaf/flower drop. | Water at soil level, remove fallen leaves/fruit, practice crop rotation. |
| **Cutworms** | Soil‑dwelling larvae that chew stems at night, killing seedlings. | Hand‑pick at night, use cardboard collars to protect stems. |
| **Downy Mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level, remove/destroy affected leaves, avoid overcrowding, use homemade milk spray or fungicide if needed. |
| **Frost Damage** | Leaves wilt and turn black. | Wait for frost danger to pass before planting; prune damaged leaves before winter. |
| **Possums, Birds, Other Animals** | Rapid harvest loss overnight. | Use netting or cages; try homemade sprays (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._) | Brown/orange raised spots or patches on foliage. | Space plants to avoid overcrowding, ensure full sun, avoid over‑fertilizing, remove dead plants, practice crop rotation. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread to cover leaves. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, use fungicide or homemade spray if necessary. |
| **Spider Mites** (Tetranychus urticae) | Dry, wilted, or discolored leaves; undersides feel sandpaper‑like. | Prune for airflow, spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulphur. |
