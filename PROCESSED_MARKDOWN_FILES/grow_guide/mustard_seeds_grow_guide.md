## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Mustard loves **full sun** or **partial shade**. Pick a spot that gets at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs to be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - **Weed** the area thoroughly, then **dig over** to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost** for a nutrient boost.  
- **Weed control:** Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.

## How to Sow Mustard Seeds

Mustard seeds are *simple* to start—no soaking or stratification required.  

1. **Direct sow**:  
   - Plant **5 mm deep**.  
   - Space seeds **30–40 cm apart** within rows, and keep rows **40–60 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep the soil **moist but not soggy**.  
3. **Germination:**  
   - Takes **7–14 days** at a soil temperature of **18–20 °C**.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  

> **Tip:** Mustard is a cool‑season crop. It will *bolt* (flower prematurely) in hot weather. Avoid transplanting seedlings or sowing in very warm temperatures unless you’re growing for seed.

## How to Grow Mustard

### Watering

- **When to water:** Test the soil 5 cm below the surface—if it feels dry, it’s time.  
- **Method:** Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid:** Spraying water on the leaves to reduce fungal risk.

### Fertilizing

- **If soil is good:** No extra fertilizer needed.  
- **If soil is poor or you want a boost:**  
  - Use a **high‑nitrogen** or leafy‑green‑specific fertilizer.  
  - **Slow‑release:** Apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm** tall.  
  - **Liquid:** Apply at the recommended rate/frequency during the growing season.  

> **Seed‑production tip:** Once plants reach mature height, **cut back on watering** to encourage flowering and seed pod formation. Don’t harvest the leaves if you’re aiming for seed.

## How to Harvest Mustard

| **What** | **When** | **How** |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Leaves** | As soon as they’re large enough to eat | Pinch off outer leaves, leaving some on the plant for regrowth. Or cut the whole plant just above ground level. |
| **Seeds** | When pods are dry and pale brown | Pick pods, crush between fingers to release seeds. Use fresh or toasted seeds, add to pickles, or make mustard condiment. |

- **Storage:** Keep leaves in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge for short‑term use.

## Common Problems When Growing Mustard

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Handle |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray<br>• Encourage predatory insects |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed production, often after extreme weather. | • Wait until frost danger is past or avoid very hot periods<br>• Water deeply and regularly during heat |
| **Cabbage Moth / Cabbage White Butterfly** | White or grey wings; eggs on leaf undersides; caterpillars create holes or skeletonize leaves. | • Use netting or decoys<br>• Hand‑pick caterpillars<br>• Targeted spray if needed |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread to cover leaves; reduces yield but rarely fatal. | • Water at soil level, not on leaves<br>• Ensure good airflow between plants<br>• Remove affected leaves<br>• Apply fungicide or homemade spray if necessary |
