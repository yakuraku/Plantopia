# How to Grow Aloe Plants  

**Family:** Asphodelaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Aloe sp._  
**Life Cycle:** perennial  

---

## Preparation  

- **Sunlight:** Aloe loves *full sun* – pick a spot that gets **at least 6 h of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Location:** Since aloes are *perennial*, choose a **permanent spot** where you won’t disturb them with regular digging.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed the area, loosen the soil, and add **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, pick a variety that’s **recommended for container growing**.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a **minimum of 10 L** pot for mature plants.  
  - During the growing season, container plants may need a little extra fertiliser to stay healthy.

## How to Plant Aloes  

Aloe plants arrive **bare‑rooted** – plant them **right after delivery**.

1. **Dig a generous hole** – at least **four times the width** of the root ball.  
2. **Plant upright** – the base of the leaves should sit level with or slightly above the soil line; **don’t bury the stem**.  
3. **Support the young plant** – use bamboo canes or stakes until the roots are firmly established.  
4. **Water and fertilise** – give a thorough soak, then apply a **weak liquid fertiliser or seaweed extract**.  
   - **Rest for ~4 weeks** to let roots settle.  
   - After that, water **once a week for the next four weeks** to encourage new growth.

> **Tip:** Aloes can handle occasional light frosts but won’t survive regular freezing temperatures.

## How to Grow Aloes  

- **Watering:**  
  - Aloe is drought‑tolerant once established.  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings; check **10 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to prevent fungal issues.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  

- **Fertilising:**  
  - If the soil is already rich, you may skip extra fertiliser.  
  - For poorer soil or a quick boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertiliser** – apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm** tall.  
    - **Liquid fertiliser** – use during flowering or fruiting, following the recommended rate and frequency.  

- **Deadheading:**  
  - Remove faded or dead flowers **regularly** during the growing season.  
  - Use sharp secateurs or snips to cut just above a set of leaves.  
  - This encourages the plant to produce more blooms.

## Common Problems When Growing Aloes  

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Handle It |
|---------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Aphids** *(2–4 mm)* | Small, sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Mealybugs** *(3–6 mm)* | White, pink, or gray cotton‑like bodies on leaves; can cause wilting and honeydew. | Wipe leaves, apply soap or alcohol spray, or encourage predators. *Read more about mealybugs here.* |
| **Scale** | Hard or soft bodies (brown, orange, grey, or white) on shoots or leaf undersides; can damage leaves and produce honeydew. | Brush or hose them off, use a soap spray, or prune heavily infested parts. *Read more about scale here.* |
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scab‑like patches; premature leaf and flower drop. | Water at soil level only, discard fallen leaves and fruit, practice crop rotation. |
| **Rust** *(Puccinia sp.)* | Brown to orange raised spots or patches on foliage; spread by wind or water, especially at 10–20 °C and high humidity. | Space plants to avoid overcrowding, ensure full sun, avoid over‑fertilising, remove dead plants, rotate crops. *Read more about rust fungus here.* |
| **Gall mites** *(Eriophyid mites)* | Microscopic, airborne pests causing bumpy or blistered foliage, abnormal growth, thick leaves, or large buds/flowers. | Identify the gall type; remove plants with damaging galls. |
| **Root rot** | Slow establishment, yellowing or wilting foliage, soft brown tissue at stem base and roots; often fatal. | Reduce soil moisture, add organic matter, keep mulch away from stems, remove and discard affected plants. |
