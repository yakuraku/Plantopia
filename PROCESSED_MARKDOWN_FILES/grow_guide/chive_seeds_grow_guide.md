## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Chives thrive in *full sun* – aim for at least **6 hours of direct light** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Choose a *well‑drained* bed enriched with plenty of organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed, loosen, and amend with **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Container Growing:**  
  - If you’re using pots, pick a variety labeled for container use.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of at least **10 L** to give chives room to grow.  
  - Remember that container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the season.

## How to Sow Chive Seeds

Chive seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification required.

1. **Direct Sowing**  
   - Plant **5 mm deep** and **15 cm apart**.  
   - Keep rows **15 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture** – keep the soil *moist but never soggy or dry*.  
3. **Germination** – expect **7–14 days** at a soil temperature of **18–21 °C**.  
4. **Protection** – shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  

**Tip:**  
- *Scatter seed* method works too: roughen the surface, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover.  
- Because seeds are tiny, mix them with sand or fine potting mix first, or use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly.  
- Press lightly into the soil to ensure good seed‑soil contact and prevent drying out.

## How to Grow Chives

- **Watering**  
  - Water when the soil feels dry **5 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil).  
  - Aim for **deep watering** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  

- **Fertilizing**  
  - If the soil was well prepared, skip extra fertilizer.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑nitrogen** or leafy‑green‑specific fertilizer:  
    - *Slow‑release*: apply at transplant or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm** tall.  
    - *Liquid*: apply at the recommended rate and frequency during the growing season.  

- **Thinning**  
  - When seedlings are large enough to handle, pull out weak or small ones to space plants **15 cm apart**.  

- **Flower Management**  
  - To prolong the plant’s life, **remove flower stalks** as soon as they appear.

## How to Harvest Chives

- **Timing:** Chives are ready in **60–90 days**.  
- **Method:** Cut the outer leaves at the base, leaving some for future growth.  
- **Storage:** Wrap in a damp paper towel, place in a perforated plastic bag, and refrigerate for short‑term use.

## Common Problems When Growing Chives

| Problem | Description | Management |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects that cluster on new shoots or leaf undersides. They can wilt leaves, discolor them, and excrete honeydew that attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray<br>• Encourage predatory insects |
| **Rust** (_Puccinia sp._) | Fungal disease producing brown‑to‑orange raised spots or patches on foliage. Spreads by wind or water, especially at 10–20 °C with high humidity. | • Space plants to avoid overcrowding<br>• Provide full sun<br>• Avoid over‑fertilizing<br>• Remove dead plants<br>• Practice crop rotation |
| **Onion Thrips** (_Thrips tabaci_) | Tiny (≤1.5 mm) flying insects with pale yellow to light brown bodies. They suck sap, leaving silver patches and reducing yield. | • Wash with a garden hose<br>• Spread organic mulch<br>• Encourage predatory mites and lacewings through companion planting |
