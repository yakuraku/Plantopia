## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Sunflowers crave *full sun* – pick a spot that gets at least **6 hours of direct sunshine** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs to be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Start by **weeding** thoroughly, then **dig over** to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost** for extra nutrients.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.  
  - *Tip:* For a deeper dive into soil prep, check out our guide on [preparing soil for planting](#).

- **Container Growing:**  
  - Choose a **container‑friendly variety** if you’re planting in pots.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot that’s at least **40 L** to give roots room to grow.  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the season to stay healthy.

## How to Sow Sunflower Seeds

Sunflower seeds are *simple* – no soaking or stratification required.  
You can either **sow directly** in the garden or **raise seedlings** in trays and transplant later.

### 1. Sow Directly

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Dig a shallow furrow and **plant seeds 10 mm deep**. |
| 2 | Space them **30–50 cm apart**. |
| 3 | Keep the soil **moist but not waterlogged**. |
| 4 | Germination takes **7–14 days** at **21–30 °C**. |
| 5 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raise Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **10 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist soil** without overwatering. |
| 4 | Germination: **7–14 days** at **21–30 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space the transplanted plants **30–50 cm apart**. |

## Growing Sunflowers

### Watering

- **When to Water:** Check the soil 5 cm below the surface; if it feels dry, it’s time to water.  
- **How to Water:** Water **deeply** in the **early morning** or **late afternoon**.  
- **Avoid Leaf Wetness:** Keep water off the foliage to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- *More on watering:* [Learn more about watering](#).

### Fertilizing

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
- **Boosting Growth:**  
  - Use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertilizer if the soil is poor.  
  - **Slow‑release** fertilizer: apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - **Liquid fertilizer:** apply during flowering or fruiting as per the product’s recommended rate and frequency.

### Support

- As sunflowers grow tall, they may need support.  
- Use **stakes, bamboo canes, trellises, or string lines**.  
- **Set up support early**—right when you sow or transplant—to avoid disturbing roots later.

### Flowering Time

- Expect **80–90 days** from sowing to flowering.

### Cutting for Blooms

- For cut flowers, use **sharp snips or secateurs** to cut the longest stems.  
- Remove lower leaves and place stems immediately in a clean bucket of water.

### Harvesting Seeds

1. **Protect the heads**: Cover whole flower heads with netting or a paper bag once petals have died to keep birds away.  
2. **Alternative method**: Cut the entire head, leave a bit of stalk, and hang it upside down in a cool, dry, airy spot.  
3. **When ready**: Seeds will become loose and easy to dislodge.  
4. **Collect**: Hold the head over a bucket, bang it against the side, and scrape remaining seeds with a fork.  
5. **Storage**: Eat raw, roast, or store in an airtight container.

## Common Problems & How to Handle Them

| Problem | What Happens | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Armyworms, cutworms, caterpillars** | Eat buds, flowers, or seeds. | Inspect plants, hand‑pick caterpillars, use insect‑exclusion netting, or spray with Dipel if needed. |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium wilt** | Roots infected → wilting, yellowing, death. | No cure; prevent by choosing resistant varieties, removing affected plants, practicing good hygiene, and rotating crops. |
| **Possums, birds, other animals** | Devour seeds overnight. | Use netting or cages; try homemade sprays (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Rust (Puccinia sp.)** | Brown/orange raised spots on leaves. | Space plants, give full sun, avoid over‑fertilizing, remove dead material, rotate crops. |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots that spread. | Water at soil level, ensure airflow, remove affected leaves, consider fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Eat tender leaves, leave slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep poultry, use traps, or torchlight collection. |
