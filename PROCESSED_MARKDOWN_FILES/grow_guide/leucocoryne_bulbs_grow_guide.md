**Family:** Amaryllidaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Leucocoryne sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Aim for **at least 6 hours of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Choose a **loose, well‑drained** mix.  
  - Work in **aged animal manure or compost** to add organic matter.  
  - For heavy soils, dig in organic material to lighten the ground so roots can spread freely.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.  
- **Container Growing:**  
  - Pick a variety suited for pots.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - The pot should hold a minimum of **10 L** to accommodate mature plants.  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the growing season.

## Planting Leucocoryne Bulbs

1. **Place bulbs** directly in their final spot—garden bed or container.  
2. **Spacing:** 5–10 cm apart.  
3. **Depth:** 5 cm deep, **pointed tip up**.  
4. **Cover** with soil and water thoroughly.  
5. **Moisture:** Keep soil damp (but not soggy) until shoots appear.

## Growing & Care

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface (*scratch a bit of soil with your finger*).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If soil is already well‑prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is usually needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - *Slow‑release* fertilizer at the recommended rate when shoots emerge, **or**  
    - Liquid fertilizer at the recommended rate and frequency at the same time.  
  - After flowering, feed with **blood & bone** or aged/pelletised chicken manure, then water well.  
- **Flowering Time:** Expect blooms in **120–180 days**.  
- **Foliage Management:**  
  - Let leaves die back naturally after flowering; the bulb reabsorbs nutrients.  
  - Once all foliage is gone, trim leaves at ground level with sharp secateurs or snips.

## Winter & Summer Protection

- **Cold Climates:** Mulch heavily over winter to shield bulbs from frost.  
- **Hot Summers:**  
  - Mulch heavily to keep bulbs cool.  
  - In wet summers, consider lifting bulbs if they become overcrowded or need relocation.

## Lifting & Storage

1. **Lift** bulbs with a garden fork, being careful not to damage them.  
2. **Prune** any dead leaves still attached.  
3. **Store** in a **cool, dry** place on a wire rack or a netted bag that allows airflow.  
4. Ideal storage temperature: **≈ 20 °C**.  
5. Avoid heat above **30 °C**, which can reduce viability.  
6. Replant the following season following the planting guidelines above.

## Common Problems

| Problem | What to Watch For | Quick Fix |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap/alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Rotten bulbs/corms** | Bulbs sit in cold, wet soil or become waterlogged; signs of rot, no roots/shoots, stunted yellow leaves, no flowers. | Plant in well‑draining soil, raised beds, or containers; avoid watering during dormancy; lift and store if needed. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves, especially at night; leave slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, spot‑collect at night, or set traps. |
