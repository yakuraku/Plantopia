Chinese cabbage seeds are *easy to handle*—no soaking or stratification required.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |

| 2 | Space **25–40 cm** between plants, **40 cm** between rows. |
| 3 | Keep soil **moist** but never **wet** or **dry**. |
| 4 | Germination takes **7–14 days** at **7–23 °C**. |
| 5 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **6 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist** soil (never wet or dry). |
| 4 | Germination: **7–14 days** at **7–23 °C**. |

## How to Grow Chinese Cabbage

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil moisture **5 cm** below the surface (scratch a bit).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
- **Fertilising:**  
  - If soil is already well‑prepared, **no extra fertiliser** is needed.  
  - For poorer soil or a nutrient boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertiliser** at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid fertiliser** applied at the recommended rate/frequency during the growing season.  
  - A high‑nitrogen or leafy‑green‑specific formula works well.

## How to Harvest Chinese Cabbage

- **Harvest window:** **40–100 days** after sowing.  
- **Non‑head varieties:**  
  - Harvest individual leaves when they’re large enough to eat.  
  - Cut at the base just above soil level.  
  - Or cut the whole plant at ground level.  
- **Head‑forming varieties:**  
  - Wait until the head is tight and fully formed.  
  - Cut the entire head at ground level.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Short‑term: Place in a **perforated plastic bag** in the fridge.  
  - Long‑term: **Ferment** or **pickle** for extended preservation.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | What Causes It | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| **Bitter taste** | Slow growth, setbacks, or late harvest | Enrich soil with aged manure, water deeply & regularly, harvest early when tender |
| **Bolting** | Extreme weather (heat or cold) | Sow after frost danger, keep plants well‑watered in hot weather |
| **Cabbage moth / white butterfly** | Eggs on leaf undersides → caterpillars eat leaves | Use netting or decoys, hand‑pick caterpillars, apply targeted insecticidal spray if needed |
| **Heads not forming** | Warm weather, slow growth, lack of water/nutrients | Confirm head‑forming variety, grow in cooler seasons (autumn/spring), water regularly, fertilise |
| **Slugs & snails** | Night‑time feeders, leave slimy trails | Remove hiding spots, use poultry, set traps, torchlight collection |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking, yellowing/wilted leaves | Hose off or spray with soap solution; destroy heavily infested plants; attract beneficial predators |
