## 2. How to Sow Warrigal Greens Seeds

Warrigal greens seeds are *easy to handle* – no soaking or stratification required.

### A. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | **Sow** seeds **10 mm deep** in the garden, spacing **50 cm** between rows and between plants. |
| 2 | Keep the soil **moist** but never **waterlogged** or **dry**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **7–12 days** at a soil temperature of **25–30 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from **pests, pets, and harsh weather** until they’re established. |

### B. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **10 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist** soil, avoiding both wet and dry extremes. |
| 4 | Germination: **7–12 days** at **25–30 °C**. |
| 5 | **Transplant** when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Plant out at **50 cm spacing** between plants and rows. |

> **Tip:** Warrigal greens are *frost‑sensitive*. Wait until the danger of frost has passed before sowing or transplanting.

## 3. Growing the Plants

### Watering

- Check soil moisture **5 cm below the surface** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
- Water **deeply** in the **early morning** or **late afternoon**.  
- **Avoid wetting the leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising

- If the soil was well prepared, **no extra fertiliser** is usually needed.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑nitrogen** or **leafy‑green‑specific** fertiliser:  
  - **Slow‑release:** apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - **Liquid:** apply at the recommended rate and frequency throughout the season.

## 4. Harvesting

- **Harvest time:** about **50 days** after sowing.  
- **When ready:** leaves are large enough to eat.  
- **Method:** cut leaves and stems with snips, leaving some on the plant to keep it growing.  
- **Oxalate note:** Warrigal greens contain oxalates – **soak in cold water for 30 min** or **blanch** before eating.  
- **Short‑term storage:** keep in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
- **Long‑term storage:** blanch and then freeze.

## 5. Common Problems & How to Handle Them

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs feeding on tender leaves, especially at night; leave slimy trails. | Remove hiding places, keep free‑range poultry, use torchlight to spot them, or set up traps. |
