# How to Grow Cauliflower Seeds

**Family:** Brassicaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Brassica oleracea botrytis_  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Choose a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Must be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, dig over to loosen, then mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.

## How to Sow Cauliflower Seeds

Cauliflower seeds are simple to start—no soaking or stratification needed.  
You can **direct‑sow** in the garden or **raise seedlings** in trays and transplant later.

### Sow Direct

1. **Plant** seeds **5 mm deep** and **45–70 cm apart**.  
2. Keep the soil **moist but never waterlogged or dry**.  
3. Germination takes **7–14 days** at a soil temperature of **10–30 °C**.  
4. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raise Seedlings

1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **high‑quality seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets).  
2. Sow seeds **5 mm deep**.  
3. Maintain **moist but not soggy** soil.  
4. Germination: **7–14 days** at **10–30 °C**.  
5. **Transplant** when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Plant out** with the same spacing: **45–70 cm apart** and rows **75–90 cm apart**.

> **Tip:** Cauliflower is a cool‑season crop. Avoid sowing or transplanting in hot weather to prevent bolting.

## How to Grow Cauliflower

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil moisture at **5 cm depth** (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the **early morning or late afternoon**.  
  - **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If soil is well‑prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is usually needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertilizer** at the recommended rate **when transplanting** or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid fertilizer** at the recommended rate and frequency **while plants are fruiting or flowering**.

## How to Harvest Cauliflower

- **Harvest window:** **100–160 days** after sowing.  
- **Readiness:** Heads are ready when fully formed but **before any flowers open**.  
- **Cutting:** Trim the head with **10–15 cm of stem**.  
- **Storage:** Keep heads in a **perforated plastic bag** in the fridge.  
- **Long‑term:** Pickle or blanch and then freeze for extended storage.

## Common Problems When Growing Cauliflower

Below are the most frequent issues and how to tackle them:

| Problem | What Happens | Quick Fixes |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Cabbage moth / cabbage white butterfly** | White or grey wings with markings; caterpillars chew large holes or skeletonise leaves. | Use netting or decoys, hand‑pick caterpillars, or apply a selective spray. |
| **Heads not forming** | Often due to warm weather, slow growth, or lack of water/nutrients. | Ensure a head‑forming variety, grow in cooler seasons (autumn/spring), water regularly, and fertilize with compost or balanced fertilizer. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set, usually after extreme heat or cold. | Sow after frost danger, avoid hot weather, water deeply during heat to reduce stress. |
| **Hollow stems** | Warm weather or excess nitrogen can cause hollow, weak stems. | Grow in cooler seasons, avoid high‑nitrogen fertilizers. Hollow stems are edible if not rotten. |
| **Aphids** | Small sap‑suckers (2–4 mm) on new shoots or leaf undersides; cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Powdery mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; reduces yield but rarely fatal. | Water at soil level, improve airflow, remove affected leaves, and apply fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Possums, birds, other animals** | Can destroy a harvest overnight. | Use netting or cages, or spray with a homemade deterrent (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Cutworms** | Moth larvae that chew through tender stems at night. | Hand‑pick at night, or use cardboard collars to protect seedlings. |
