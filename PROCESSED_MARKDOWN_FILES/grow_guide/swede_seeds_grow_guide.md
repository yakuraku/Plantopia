# How to Grow Swede Seeds

**Family:** Brassicaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Brassica napus var. napobrassica_  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Swedes thrive in **full sun** or **partial shade**. Pick a spot that gets at least **3 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:** Use a **loose, well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed the area thoroughly.  
  - Dig to at least a spade’s depth to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost** to lighten heavy soils and give roots room to grow.  
- **Weed control:** Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.

## How to Sow Swede Seeds

Swede seeds are simple to handle—no soaking or stratification needed. You can **sow directly** in the garden or **raise seedlings** in trays before transplanting.

### Sow Direct

1. **Plant depth:** 10 mm (about ½ inch).  
2. **Spacing:** 10–20 cm between seeds; rows 30–50 cm apart.  
3. **Moisture:** Keep soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
4. **Germination:** 4–10 days at 16–30 °C.  
5. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raise Seedlings

1. **Containers:** Use trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a high‑quality seed‑raising mix (or soil starter pellets).  
2. **Plant depth:** 10 mm.  
3. **Moisture:** Same rule—moist but not soggy.  
4. **Germination:** 4–10 days at 16–30 °C.  
5. **Transplant:** When seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. **Planting out:** Space plants 10–20 cm apart, rows 30–50 cm apart.

## How to Grow Swede

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil 5 cm below the surface; if dry, water.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting foliage to reduce fungal disease risk.

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If soil is well‑prepared, **no extra fertilizer** is needed.  
  - Over‑fertilizing can lead to lush leaves at the expense of root growth.  
  - In poor soil, use a low‑nitrogen, high‑phosphorus fertilizer (e.g., **blood and bone**) at the recommended rate.

## How to Harvest Swedes

- **Timing:** Roots are ready in **80–100 days**.  
- **Method:**  
  - Gently pull at the base of the leaves or use a garden fork to lift multiple roots.  
  - Shake off excess soil.  
  - Cut foliage **1–2 cm above** the root.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Store in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - For longer term, consider **canning** or **fermenting**.

## Common Problems When Growing Swedes

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention / Remedy |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Cabbage moth / cabbage white butterfly** | White/grey wings with markings; caterpillars chew holes, skeletonise leaves | Use netting or decoys; hand‑pick caterpillars; targeted sprays if needed. |
| **Boron deficiency** | Yellow leaf tips, hollow or discoloured stems, soft brown root centres | Apply 1 Tbsp household boron dissolved in 5 L water to seedlings 5–10 cm tall. **Do not use as a general fertilizer**—boron can be toxic. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed set | Avoid sowing before frost danger or during extreme heat. Water regularly and deeply during hot spells to prevent heat stress. |
| **Split roots** | Roots split or become uneven | Maintain consistent, deep watering; consider recent or expected rainfall before watering. |
| **Tough roots** | Roots become hard and woody | Harvest earlier when roots are tender. |
| **Small roots** | Roots remain small | Sow at proper spacing; avoid over‑fertilizing, which encourages foliage over root growth. Thin seedlings if needed. |
