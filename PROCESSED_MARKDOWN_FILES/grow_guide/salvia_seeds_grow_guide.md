# How to Grow Salvia Seeds  

**Family:** Lamiaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Salvia sp._  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial (sometimes grown as an annual)  

## Preparation  
Salvia loves **full sun**—pick a spot that gets at least **6 hours of direct light** each day.  

- **Perennials**: Plant in a permanent location so the roots can grow without disturbance.  
- **Soil**: Needs to be **well‑drained** and rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, loosen the soil, and mix in aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.  
- **Containers**: If you’re growing in pots, choose a variety suited for container life.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
  - Aim for a **minimum of 10 L** (≈2.6 gal) to give the plant room to grow.  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the growing season.  

## How to Sow Salvia Seeds  
Salvia seeds are **easy to handle**—no soaking or stratification required.  

### 1. Sow Directly in the Garden  
1. **Plant** seeds **4 mm deep** and **30 cm apart**.  
2. Keep the soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
3. Germination takes **12–15 days** at a soil temperature of **22–24 °C**.  
4. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  

### 2. Raise Seedlings First  
1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix (or soil starter pellets).  
2. Sow seeds **4 mm deep**.  
3. Maintain **moist but not soggy** soil.  
4. Germinate in **12–15 days** at **22–24 °C**.  
5. **Transplant** when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. Space plants **30 cm apart** in the garden.  

> **Optional**: In cooler climates, start seeds indoors **6 weeks before the last expected frost**. Keep them in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.  

## How to Grow Salvia  
Once established, salvia is **drought tolerant** and thrives in **dry, well‑drained soil**.  

- **Watering**:  
  - Let the soil dry out between waterings.  
  - Water only when the soil is dry **10 cm below the surface** (test by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  

- **Fertilizing** (if needed):  
  - **Slow‑release** fertilizer at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
  - **Liquid** fertilizer during fruiting or flowering, following the label’s rate and frequency.  

- **Pruning & Pinching**:  
  - Pinch off the growing tips with sharp secateurs or snips to encourage denser growth, stronger stems, and more flowers.  
  - After flowering, trim back stems just above a set of lower leaves to tidy the plant and promote new growth.  

- **Flowering Time**: Salvia typically blooms in **≈75 days**.  

## Common Problems When Growing Salvia  

| Pest / Issue | What It Looks Like | How to Handle |
|--------------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves; can cover entire leaf surface. | Water at soil level (not on leaves), improve air flow, remove affected leaves, and apply a suitable fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that nibble tender leaves at night, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding places, use free‑range poultry, spot‑collect by torchlight, or set traps. |
| **Spider Mites** | Tiny (≈0.2 mm) two‑spotted arachnids; leaves become dry, wilted, or discolored; undersides feel sandpaper‑like. | Prune for better air flow, spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulphur. |
| **Thrips** | Black, beige, or white flying insects (<1.5 mm); larvae leave tiny white or transparent marks on leaves and petals. | Wash plants with a garden hose, encourage predatory mites and lacewings via companion planting, or spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |
