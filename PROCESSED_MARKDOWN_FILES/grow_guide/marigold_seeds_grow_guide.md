# How to Grow Marigold Seeds

**Family:** Asteraceae  
**Binomial name:** *Tagetes sp.*  
**Life Cycle:** Annual

## Preparation

Marigolds are notorious for *self‑seeding*. At season’s end they drop seeds that can germinate next year.  
- **If you want them to stay wild:** choose a spot that welcomes new plants.  
- **If you want to keep them tidy:** deadhead before seed drop or grow them in containers.

**Sun & Soil**  
- **Sun:** Full sun is essential – at least **6 hours a day**.  
- **Soil:** Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly.  
  - Loosen the soil by digging or turning.  
  - Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

**Container Growing**  
- Pick a variety suited for pots.  
- Use a high‑quality potting mix.  
- **Container size:** Minimum **20 L** for mature plants.  
- Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## How to Sow Marigold Seeds

Marigold seeds need **no pre‑treatment** (no soaking or stratification).

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sow seeds **5 mm** deep, **20–40 cm** apart. |
| 2 | Keep soil **moist**—never waterlogged or dry. |
| 3 | Germination: **4–10 days** at **24–28 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and weather until established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings First

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix or soil starter pellets. |
| 2 | Sow seeds **5 mm** deep. |
| 3 | Keep soil moist but not saturated. |
| 4 | Germination: **4–10 days** at **24–28 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm** tall. |
| 6 | Space plants **20–40 cm** apart in the garden. |

> **Tip:** Marigolds are frost‑sensitive. **Never sow or transplant** until the danger of frost has passed.

> **Scatter Method:** For a casual approach, roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil.

> **Indoor Start (Cool Climates):** Begin indoors **6 weeks** before the last expected frost. Keep them warm with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Marigold

### Watering

- Water when the soil is **dry about 5 cm** below the surface (check by finger).  
- **Deep watering** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Avoid wetting leaves** to reduce fungal disease risk.

### Fertilising

- **Well‑prepared soil** usually needs no extra fertiliser.  
- In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flower‑specific** fertiliser.

| Type | When & How |
|------|------------|
| Slow‑release | Apply at transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm** tall, at the recommended rate. |
| Liquid | Apply at the recommended rate and frequency while plants are flowering or fruiting. |

> **Optional Pruning:** Pinch out the growing tips to encourage denser growth, stronger stems, and more flowers. Use sharp secateurs or snips to remove the top set of leaves, cutting just above a lower leaf set.

### Flowering & Deadheading

- Marigolds typically **flower in 80–90 days**.  
- **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading or dead flowers just above a leaf set with sharp secateurs or snips. This encourages continuous blooming.

## Common Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Damping Off** | Seeds fail to germinate or seedlings rot, becoming soft and mushy at the base. | Use fresh potting mix, avoid waterlogged soil, and keep foliage dry. |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White spots that spread across leaves. | Water at soil level, improve air circulation, remove affected leaves, and apply a suitable fungicide or homemade spray if needed. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Tender leaves and shoots eaten at night, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding places, keep poultry free‑range, use traps, or spot‑treat with safe slug deterrents. |
