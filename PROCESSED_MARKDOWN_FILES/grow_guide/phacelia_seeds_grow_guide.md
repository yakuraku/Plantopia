# How to Grow Phacelia Seeds

**Family:** Boraginaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Phacelia tanacetifolia_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Plant in a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of full sun** each day.  
- **Soil:** Needs a **well‑drained** mix rich in organic matter.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area.  
  - Dig over the soil to loosen it.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
- Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.  
- *Tip:* If you’re unsure how to prep your soil, **learn more about preparing soil for planting here**.

**Self‑seeding note:** Phacelia often drops seed at season’s end, which can germinate next year.  
- Choose a spot where new plants are welcome.  
- If you want to keep it from spreading, **deadhead** before seed drop or grow in containers.

## How to Sow Phacelia Seeds

Phacelia seeds are simple to handle—no soaking or stratification needed.

1. **Plant depth & spacing**  
   - Sow **5 mm deep** and **30 cm apart**.  
2. **Light exclusion**  
   - Cover seeds with soil to keep them dark.  
   - Alternatively, place a board or black plastic over the seeds until they sprout, then remove it.  
3. **Moisture**  
   - Keep soil **moist but never soggy or dry**.  
4. **Germination**  
   - Expect **14–28 days** at a soil temperature of **12–16 °C**.  
5. **Protection**  
   - Young seedlings need shelter from pests, pets, and weather until established.  

**Frost warning:** Phacelia is half‑hardy. Mature plants tolerate light frosts, but seedlings must be protected. **Do not transplant or sow outside until all danger of frost has passed.**  

*Patience is key:* Some varieties germinate slowly—stick to the depth and temperature guidelines for best results.

## How to Grow Phacelia

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil is dry **about 5 cm below the surface** (check by scratching a bit of soil).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting leaves to prevent fungal diseases.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  
- **Fertilizer:** Thrives in nutrient‑poor soil; **no extra fertilizer needed** during the growing season.  
- **Flowering:** Expect blooms in **90–110 days**.

## Common Problems When Growing Phacelia

| Pest/Disease | What It Looks Like | Why It Matters | How to Manage |
|--------------|--------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | Can weaken plants and spread pests. | • Spray with a garden hose.<br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray.<br>• Encourage natural predators. <br>• *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that nibble tender leaves at night, leaving slimy trails. | Damage foliage and reduce plant vigor. | • Remove hiding spots.<br>• Keep free‑range poultry.<br>• Spot‑collect by torchlight.<br>• Use traps. <br>• *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
| **Thrips** | Tiny (≤1.5 mm) black/beige/white insects; larvae leave tiny white or transparent marks on leaves and petals. | Aesthetic damage; can transmit pathogens. | • Wash plants with a garden hose.<br>• Encourage predatory mites and lacewings via companion planting.<br>• Spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. <br>• *Read more about thrips here.* |
