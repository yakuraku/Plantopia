# How to Grow Spinach Seeds

**Family:** Amaranthaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Spinacia oleracea_  
**Life Cycle:** Biennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Light:** Spinach thrives in **full sun or part shade**. Aim for at least **3 hours of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Soil:** Needs a **well‑drained** mix rich in **organic matter**.  
  - Thoroughly weed the area.  
  - Dig or till to loosen the soil.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure** or **compost**.  
  - Keep the bed weed‑free until planting.  
- **Containers:**  
  - Choose a spinach variety suited for pots.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix**.  
  - Pick a container of at least **20 L** to give plants room to grow.  
  - Container plants may need **extra fertiliser** during the season.

## How to Sow Spinach Seeds

Spinach seeds are **ready to plant straight away** – no soaking or stratification required.

1. **Planting depth & spacing**  
   - Sow **8 mm deep**.  
   - Space seeds **25–35 cm apart** in rows that are **40–50 cm apart**.  
2. **Moisture** – keep the soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
3. **Germination** – seeds sprout in **5–10 days** when the soil temperature is **4–25 °C**.  
4. **Protection** – shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.  

> **Tip:** If you prefer a quicker start, try the *scatter seed* method: roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil.

## How to Grow Spinach

- **Watering**  
  - Check soil moisture 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.  
- **Fertilising**  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra feed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑nitrogen** or leafy‑green‑specific fertiliser.  
    - *Slow‑release*: apply at transplant or when seedlings reach 5–10 cm.  
    - *Liquid*: apply at the recommended rate and frequency during the season.  
- **Thinning** (optional)  
  - When seedlings are large enough, pull out weak or small ones to space plants **25–35 cm apart**.

## How to Harvest Spinach

- **Timing** – spinach is ready in **50–100 days**.  
- **Method**  
  - Cut individual leaves when they’re large enough to eat.  
  - Or cut the entire plant at ground level.  
- **Storage**  
  - Fresh leaves: keep in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.  
  - Longer term: blanch and freeze.

## Common Problems When Growing Spinach

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Fix |
|---------|--------------------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may leave honeydew attracting ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or attract predatory insects. |
| **Bacterial leaf spot** | Brown, irregular spots that dry into scab‑like patches; premature leaf drop. | Water at soil level, discard fallen leaves, practice crop rotation. |
| **Bitter taste** | Slow growth, setbacks, or late harvest. | Enrich soil with aged manure, water deeply and regularly, harvest young and tender leaves. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed production, often after extreme weather. | Sow after frost danger, avoid hot weather, water deeply during heat. |
| **Damping off** | Seeds fail to germinate or seedlings rot at the base. | Use fresh potting mix, avoid waterlogged soil, keep foliage dry. |
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches, especially on leaf undersides. | Water at soil level, remove affected leaves, ensure good airflow; consider a homemade milk spray or fungicide. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Night‑time leaf damage, slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, use free‑range poultry, set traps, or torchlight collection. |
| **Yellowing leaves** | Nutrient deficiency sign. | Apply nitrogen‑rich or leafy‑green fertiliser; a liquid or foliar feed works quickly. |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insects on leaf undersides, causing yellowing or wilting. | Hose spray or soap spray; destroy severely affected plants; attract beneficial predators. |
