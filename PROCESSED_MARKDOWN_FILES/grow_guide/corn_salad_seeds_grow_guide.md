# How to Grow Corn Salad Seeds

**Family:** Caprifoliaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Valerianella locusta_  
**Life Cycle:** Annual  

## Preparation

Corn salad loves **full sun to part shade** – aim for at least **3 h of direct sunlight** each day.  
- **Soil:** Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, dig over to loosen, then mix in aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.  
- **Containers:** Works great in pots.  
  - Choose a variety suited for container growing.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot of **at least 20 L**.  
  - Container plants often need a bit more fertilizer during the season.

## How to Sow Corn Salad Seeds

Corn salad seeds are *easy* – no soaking or stratification needed.  
You can sow them **directly in the garden** or **raise seedlings** first.

### Sow Directly

1. **Depth & spacing:** 6 mm deep, 20 cm apart, rows 30–45 cm apart.  
2. **Moisture:** Keep soil consistently moist but never waterlogged.  
3. **Germination:** 7–12 days at 10–20 °C.  
4. **Protection:** Shield young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raise Seedlings First

1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a good seed‑raising mix (or soil starter pellets).  
2. Sow 6 mm deep.  
3. Keep soil moist but not soggy.  
4. Germination: 7–12 days at 10–20 °C.  
5. **Transplant** when seedlings have their first true leaves and are 5–10 cm tall.  
6. **Plant out** with the same spacing as direct sowing (20 cm apart, rows 30–45 cm).

> **Tip:** Corn salad is a cool‑season crop. Avoid sowing or transplanting in hot weather to prevent bolting.

> **Scatter Seed Method:** Roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil for a quick, informal planting.

## How to Grow Corn Salad

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil feels dry about 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water deeply in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - Well‑prepared soil usually needs no extra fertilizer.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a high‑nitrogen or leafy‑green‑specific fertilizer.  
    - **Slow‑release:** Apply at transplant or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
    - **Liquid:** Follow the recommended rate and frequency during the growing season.  

- **Thinning (Optional):**  
  - When seedlings are large enough, pull out weaker ones so plants are spaced ~20 cm apart.

## How to Harvest Corn Salad

- **Timing:** 45–60 days after sowing.  
- **Method:**  
  - Cut the entire plant at ground level when leaves are large enough to eat.  
  - Or practice “cut‑and‑come‑again”: pinch or cut a few outer leaves, leaving some on the plant for regrowth.  
- **Storage:** Keep in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge for short‑term use.

## Common Problems & How to Handle Them

| Problem | What It Looks Like | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑suckers on new shoots or leaf undersides; may cause wilting, discoloration, and honeydew that attracts ants. | Spray with a garden hose, use a soap or alcohol spray, or invite predatory insects. |
| **Bolting** | Premature flowering and seed production, often after a heat spell. | Sow after frost danger, keep plants well‑watered and cool. |
| **Cutworms** | Moth larvae (3–4 cm) that chew through tender stems at night, killing seedlings. | Hand‑pick at night, or use cardboard collars around stems. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Molluscs that nibble tender leaves, leaving slimy trails, especially at night. | Remove hiding spots, use free‑range poultry, spot‑collect by torchlight, or set traps. |
