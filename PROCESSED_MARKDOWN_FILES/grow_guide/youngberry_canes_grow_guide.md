## Preparation

Youngberry plants are **perennials**, so choose a permanent spot where they can grow *undisturbed* by regular digging.  

- **Sunlight:** Full sun or part shade. Aim for **at least 3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:** Well‑drained, rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly.  
  - Loosen the soil by digging or tilling.  
  - Add aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until planting.

## How to Plant Youngberry Canes

Plant as soon as you receive the canes—don’t let the roots dry out.

1. **Remove** the cane from its bag and shake off the coir.  
2. **Soak** the roots in a bucket of water for **1–2 h** (no longer than 2 h to avoid rot).  
   - *Optional:* Add seaweed solution at the recommended rate.  
3. **Spacing:** Plant canes **150–180 cm apart**.  
4. **Dig** a **30 cm deep** hole and create a small mound in the center.  
5. **Place** the roots on the mound, spreading them evenly.  
6. **Cover** with soil, ensuring the bottom of the stem is level with the soil surface.  
7. **Water** in well after planting.  

**Optional:** Prune the cane to about **20 cm** above the ground after planting to encourage root development and new growth.

## How to Grow Youngberry Canes (Support & Care)

- **Support:** Youngberries need a sturdy trellis or similar structure.  
  - Tie gently with twine or plant ties.  
  - Set up the support *before* planting to avoid disturbing roots later.  
  - Bundling canes and training them in a wave shape along the trellis makes management easier.  

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil moisture 5 cm below the surface (scratch a bit with your finger).  
  - Water deeply in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal risk.

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If soil is well‑prepared, no extra fertilizer is usually needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost:  
    - *Slow‑release fertilizer* at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings are 5–10 cm tall.  
    - *Liquid fertilizer* at the recommended rate and frequency during fruiting or flowering.

## How to Prune Youngberry Canes

Youngberries produce fruit on **two‑year‑old canes** (floricanes). Two common pruning methods:

### Method 1 – Tie‑and‑Prune  
1. While fruiting, mark fruiting canes with a soft tie (e.g., wool).  
2. In winter, prune those marked canes to the ground.  
3. Leave unpruned new canes—they will fruit next year.

### Method 2 – Bundle‑and‑Train  
1. Bundle the year‑old canes and train them to higher wires on the trellis.  
2. As new canes emerge, tie them to lower wires during the growing season.  
3. In winter, prune the old canes to the ground.  
4. Bundle the new canes and train them to higher wires for the next season.

**Seasonal pruning** helps encourage branching, removes weak or diseased canes, and improves airflow.

**Suckers:** New shoots that appear some distance from the parent plant can be dug up for propagation or cut below soil level to control spread.

## How to Harvest Youngberry

- **When to pick:** Firm and fully coloured.  
- **Method:** Gently pull the fruit off the plant.  
- **Best use:** Eat soon after harvest.  
- **Short‑term storage:** Keep in a container in the fridge.  
- **Long‑term options:** Freeze, can, or make jam/sauce.

## Common Problems When Growing Youngberry

| Problem | What It Looks Like | How to Deal |
|---------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Grey mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Mouldy flowers, rotting fruit; thrives in cool, damp weather. | Prune affected parts. Water at soil level (not on leaves). Apply suitable fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Queensland Fruit Fly** _(Bactrocera tryoni)_ | Fruit rots from inside; larvae visible when cut open. | Dispose of fallen fruit. Use insect‑exclusion netting. Install traps to monitor populations. |
| **Animals (possums, birds, etc.)** | Rapid loss of harvest. | Netting or cages. Homemade deterrent spray (garlic, fish oil, mustard). |
| **Fusarium & Verticillium wilt** | Wilting, yellowing leaves; dry, dying branches. | No cure. Choose resistant varieties, remove affected plants and soil, practice good hygiene and crop rotation. |
| **Thrips** | Tiny insects (<1.5 mm); leaves/flowers show small white or transparent marks. | Wash with a hose. Encourage predatory mites/lacewings via companion planting. Spray with soap, eco‑oil, or neem oil. |
| **Spider mites** (Tetranychus urticae) | Dry, wilted, discoloured leaves; undersides feel sandpaper‑like. | Prune for airflow. Spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulphur. |
