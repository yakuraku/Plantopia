# How to Grow Armeria Seeds

**Family:** Plumbaginaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Armeria maritima_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial  

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Armeria loves *full sun* – pick a spot that gets at least **6 hours of direct light** each day.  
- **Permanent spot:** As a perennial, it thrives when left undisturbed. Choose a location that won’t be dug up regularly.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Needs *well‑drained* soil rich in organic matter.  
  - Weed thoroughly, loosen the ground, and mix in aged animal manure or compost.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.

- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, pick a variety suited for container life.  
  - Use a high‑quality potting mix and a pot that holds at least **10 L** for mature plants.  
  - Container plants often need extra fertiliser during the growing season.

## Optional Seed Treatment

- **Cold stratification & soaking** can boost germination:  
  1. Refrigerate seeds **7–10 days**.  
  2. Soak overnight in warm water.  
  3. Soaking softens hard seed coats, breaking dormancy and encouraging germination.

## How to Sow Armeria Seeds

### Sow Direct

1. **Plant** seeds *0 mm deep* (just surface‑level) and space them **20 cm apart**.  
2. Keep the soil **moist but never soggy or dry**.  
3. Germination takes **7–14 days** at a soil temperature of **21–24 °C**.  
4. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raise Seedlings

1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a *good quality seed‑raising mix* (or soil starter pellets).  
2. Sow seeds **0 mm deep**.  
3. Maintain moist soil—never wet or dry.  
4. Germination: **7–14 days** at **21–24 °C**.  
5. When seedlings have their first true leaves and are **5–10 cm tall**, transplant them to the garden.  
6. Space the planted seedlings **20 cm apart**.

## How to Grow Armeria

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil feels dry **5 cm below the surface** (check by gently scratching the soil).  
  - Water *deeply* in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *Learn more about watering here.*  

- **Fertilising:**  
  - If the soil was well prepared, no extra fertiliser is needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a high‑potassium or flowering‑plant fertiliser:  
    - **Slow‑release**: apply at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid**: apply at the recommended rate/frequency while plants are fruiting or flowering.  

- **Flowering:**  
  - Armeria typically blooms in **≈100 days**.  
  - **Deadhead** regularly: cut fading or dead flowers just above a set of leaves with sharp secateurs or snips.  
  - Removing spent blooms encourages more flowering.

## Common Problems When Growing Armeria

| Problem | Symptoms | Prevention / Fix |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| **Crown rot** | Soil‑borne fungal disease; roots and plant centre rot; lower stems and branches turn brown, plant dies from the bottom up. | Reduce soil moisture, avoid overwatering, ensure excellent drainage, or grow in raised beds/containers. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Molluscs that nibble tender leaves and shoots, especially at night, leaving slimy trails. | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, spot‑collect at night, or set up traps. |
