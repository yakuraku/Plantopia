## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Endive loves *full sun*. Pick a spot that gets **at least 6 hours of direct sunshine** each day.  
- **Soil:** Aim for *well‑drained* loam rich in organic matter.  
  1. Thoroughly weed the area.  
  2. Turn the soil to loosen it.  
  3. Mix in **aged animal manure or compost**.  
- Keep the bed weed‑free until you plant.

## How to Sow Endive Seeds

Endive seeds are *simple*—no soaking or stratification needed. You can **direct‑sow** or raise seedlings in trays and transplant later.

### 1. Direct Sowing

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sprinkle seeds **5 mm deep** and **20–30 cm apart**. |
| 2 | Keep the soil **moist but never soggy or dry**. |
| 3 | Germination takes **4–7 days** at **15–18 °C**. |
| 4 | Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established. |

### 2. Raising Seedlings

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **high‑quality seed‑raising mix** (or soil starter pellets). |
| 2 | Sow seeds **5 mm deep**. |
| 3 | Maintain **moist but not waterlogged** soil. |
| 4 | Germinate in **4–7 days** at **15–18 °C**. |
| 5 | Transplant when seedlings have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**. |
| 6 | Space plants **20–30 cm apart** in the garden. |

**Scatter‑Seed Method:**  
If you prefer a quick approach, simply roughen the soil, scatter seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil.

## How to Grow Endive

- **Watering:**  
  - Check soil moisture by scratching a bit of soil with your finger; water when it’s dry about **5 cm below the surface**.  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk.  
  - *More on watering:* [Watering Guide](#).

- **Thinning:**  
  - Once seedlings are large enough to handle, pull out weak ones so that plants are spaced **20–30 cm apart**.

- **Fertilizing:**  
  - If the soil is already well‑prepared, you usually don’t need extra fertilizer.  
  - For poorer soils or a nutrient boost:  
    - **Slow‑release fertilizer** at the recommended rate when transplanting or when seedlings reach **5–10 cm**.  
    - **Liquid fertilizer** at the recommended rate and frequency during the growing season.

## How to Harvest Endive

- **Timing:** Harvest 50–80 days after sowing.  
- **Method:**  
  - *Leaves:* Pinch off outer leaves, leaving some on the plant for continued growth.  
  - *Whole heads:* Cut at ground level.  
- **Aftercare:**  
  - Consume fresh as soon as possible.  
  - Store short‑term in a perforated plastic bag in the fridge.

## Common Problems When Growing Endive

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Bitter taste** | Slow growth, setbacks, or late harvest | Enrich soil with aged manure, water deeply & regularly, harvest young and tender leaves |
| **Bolting** | Extreme weather, early sowing | Wait until after frost danger or very hot periods, water regularly & deeply during heat |
| **Damping off** | Fungal infection from soil | Use fresh potting mix for seedlings, avoid watering foliage, keep soil from becoming waterlogged |
| **Heads not forming** | Warm weather, slow growth, lack of water/nutrients | Ensure you’re growing a head‑forming type, plant in autumn/spring in warm climates, water regularly, add compost or fertilizer |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Night‑time feeders, leave trails | Remove hiding spots, keep free‑range poultry, use traps or torchlight collection |
| **Whitefly** | Sap‑sucking insect, often in large numbers | Hose off or spray with soap solution; destroy severely affected plants; attract beneficial predators |
