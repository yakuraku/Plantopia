# How to Grow Snapdragon Seeds

**Family:** Plantaginaceae  
**Binomial name:** _Antirhinum majus_  
**Life Cycle:** Perennial (usually grown as an annual)

## Preparation

- **Sunlight:** Snapdragons thrive in **full sun to part shade**. Aim for at least **3 h of direct sun** each day.  
- **Soil:**  
  - Use a **well‑drained** mix rich in **organic matter**.  
  - Thoroughly weed, then loosen the soil with a spade or tiller.  
  - Mix in **aged animal manure or compost** for extra nutrients.  
  - Keep the area weed‑free until you plant.  
  - *Learn more about preparing soil for planting here.*  
- **Containers:**  
  - If you’re growing in pots, choose a variety **recommended for container use**.  
  - Use a **high‑quality potting mix** and a pot of at least **10 L** to give roots room to grow.  
  - Container plants often need a bit more **fertiliser** during the growing season.

## How to Sow Snapdragon Seeds

Snapdragon seeds can be sown **directly in the garden** or **raised in trays** and transplanted once established.

### Sow Direct

1. **Plant** seeds **3 mm deep** and **15–25 cm apart**.  
2. Keep the soil **moist but never waterlogged**.  
3. Germination takes **7–14 days** at a soil temperature of **21–24 °C**.  
4. Protect young seedlings from pests, pets, and harsh weather until they’re established.

### Raise Seedlings

1. Fill trays, punnets, or jiffy pots with a **seed‑raising mix** (or use soil starter pellets).  
2. Sow seeds **3 mm deep**.  
3. Maintain **moist but not soggy** soil.  
4. Germinate in **7–14 days** at **21–24 °C**.  
5. Transplant when seedlings have their **first true leaves** and are **5–10 cm tall**.  
6. Space plants **15–25 cm apart** when planting out.

> **Tip:** For a quick start, try the *scatter seed* method: roughen the soil, sprinkle seeds evenly, then lightly cover with soil.

> **Tip:** Snapdragon seeds are tiny—handle them with care. Mix seeds with sand or fine potting mix before sowing, or use a seed dispenser, damp toothpick, or tweezers to space them evenly. Press lightly into the soil to ensure good contact. *Read more about sowing small seeds here.*

> **Optional:** In cooler climates, start seeds indoors **6 weeks before the last expected frost**. Keep them in a warm spot with plenty of natural light.

## How to Grow Snapdragon

- **Watering:**  
  - Water when the soil is dry **≈5 cm below the surface** (check by scratching a bit of soil with your finger).  
  - Water **deeply** in the early morning or late afternoon.  
  - Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce fungal disease risk. *Learn more about watering here.*

- **Fertilising:**  
  - If the soil was well‑prepared, no extra fertiliser is needed.  
  - In poorer soil or for a boost, use a **high‑potassium** or **flowering‑plant** fertiliser:  
    - *Slow‑release:* apply at transplanting or when seedlings are **5–10 cm tall**.  
    - *Liquid:* apply at the recommended rate while plants are flowering.

- **Thinning & Pinching:**  
  - Thin seedlings to **15–25 cm spacing** once they’re large enough to handle.  
  - Pinch the growing tips with sharp secateurs to encourage **denser growth** and **more flowers**. Cut just above a set of lower leaves.

- **Flowering Time:** Snapdragons typically flower in **110–120 days**.

- **Deadheading:**  
  - Regularly remove faded or dead flowers just above a set of leaves to promote more blooms.  
  - Use sharp secateurs or snips. *Learn more about deadheading flowering plants here.*

- **Cut Flowers:**  
  - For bouquets, cut the longest stems with sharp snips, remove lower leaves, and place immediately in clean water. *Learn more about cutting and conditioning homegrown flowers here.*

- **Perennial Care:**  
  - After flowering, prune back to tidy the plant and encourage strong new growth. Cut stems just above a set of lower leaves with sharp tools.

## Common Problems When Growing Snapdragon

Snapdragons can encounter a few pests and diseases. Below are the most common issues and how to tackle them.

| Problem | Symptoms | Management |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Aphids** | Small (2–4 mm) sap‑sucking insects on new shoots or leaf undersides; leaves may wilt or discolor; honeydew attracts ants. | • Spray with a garden hose to dislodge them. <br>• Use a soap or alcohol spray. <br>• Encourage predatory insects. <br>• *Read more about aphids here.* |
| **Grey mould** (_Botrytis_ sp.) | Mouldy flowers and rotting fruit; spores spread by wind, survive in soil or green waste. | • Prune affected flowers/fruit. <br>• Water at soil level, not on leaves. <br>• Apply appropriate fungicide or homemade spray. |
| **Downy mildew** | Yellow‑to‑grey‑brown patches on leaves, especially undersides. | • Water at soil level. <br>• Remove and destroy affected leaves. <br>• Avoid overcrowding to improve airflow. <br>• Use homemade milk spray or fungicide if needed. |
| **Slugs & Snails** | Tender leaves and shoots eaten at night; slimy trails. | • Remove hiding places. <br>• Keep free‑range poultry. <br>• Collect by torchlight or use traps. <br>• *Read more about slugs and snails here.* |
| **Spider mites** (Tetranychus urticae) | Dry, wilted, or discolored leaves; undersides feel sandpaper‑like. | • Prune for better airflow. <br>• Spray with eco‑oil or wettable sulphur. <br>• *Learn more about managing spider mites here.* |
| **Whitefly** | Yellowing or wilting leaves; large swarms on undersides. | • Hose off or spray with soap solution. <br>• Destroy severely affected plants. <br>• Attract beneficial insects that prey on whitefly. <br>• *Read more about managing whitefly here.* |
