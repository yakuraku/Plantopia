# Compost Tea – Thrifty, Easy, and Great for Your Plants  
**11 March 2021**

## Why Use Compost Tea?  
A garden is a living system that constantly loses nutrients when you harvest, weed, or trim. Compost tea turns that waste into a powerful, liquid fertilizer that:

- **Recycles** weeds, cuttings, and crop debris into a nutrient‑rich brew.  
- Provides a **fast, flexible feed** whenever your plants need a boost.  
- **Strengthens** plants against pests and disease.  
- **Improves soil structure** by boosting beneficial microbes for a healthier ecosystem.  

And the best part? It’s simple to make with just a few household items and a few weeks of waiting.

## How to Make Compost Tea  
You’ll need:

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Large bucket or container with a lid | Holds the brew |
| Hessian bag or old towel | Holds the ingredients |
| String | Secures the bag |
| Water | Medium for fermentation |
| Organic materials | Fermentation food |

### Choosing Your Ingredients  
- **Invasive weeds** (e.g., dandelion, crabgrass) are ideal. They’re nutrient‑dense and, when brewed, you’re effectively “killing” the plant so it can be safely composted afterward.  
- **Soft plant cuttings, grass clippings, roots, etc.** add extra nutrients.  
- **Avoid toxic plants** if you plan to feed edible crops.  
- Optional extras: partially decomposed compost, straw, a handful of ordinary soil to seed the microbe population.

## Putting It All Together  

1. **Bundle the ingredients** in the cloth or towel and tie it up.  
2. **Place the bundle** in the container.  
   - *Tip:* Hang the string over the side for easy removal, or suspend the bag from a stick across the top.  
3. **Add water** until the bag is fully submerged, leaving a couple of inches below the rim to prevent splashing.  
4. **Let the water sit** for a couple of days if using tap water (chlorine will dissipate).  
5. **Cover loosely** and let fermentation begin.  
   - Stir gently 2–3 times a day if you like.  
6. **Watch the smell** – a strong, slightly unpleasant odor after 1–2 days is normal. Keep the container away from living areas.  
7. **After 2–3 weeks** the brew turns dark brown and the odor fades.  
   - Remove the bag, add the solids to your compost heap, and strain the liquid.  
8. **Store** the tea in loosely capped containers to allow gases to escape, or use it immediately.  

*If you skip the bag, the brew will be messier and contain more sediment, making it harder to use with spray bottles or watering cans.*

## How to Use Compost Tea  

| Plant type | Dilution | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Seedlings, delicate plants, houseplants | 1 part tea : 20 parts water | Keeps salt levels low |
| General use (ground fertilizer) | 1 part tea : 10 parts water | Aim for a weak black‑coffee color |
| Foliar feeding | Same as general use | Test on a small area first; if the plant tolerates it, spray the rest |

**Application Tips**

- **Ground fertilizer:** Water the soil lightly first so the tea can penetrate rather than pool.  
- **Foliar spray:** Use a fine mist to avoid leaf burn.  
- **Frequency:** Roughly every two weeks, or more often during rapid growth, flowering, or fruiting periods.

## A Note for Edible Crops  

- **Microorganisms** in the tea are harmless but not meant for direct ingestion.  
- **Avoid feeding** edible plants for a few days before harvest.  
- **Wash produce** thoroughly before eating or cooking.  
- **Wear gloves** when handling the tea; splashes can be pungent even after washing.  

With a little care, homemade compost tea is an inexpensive, effective way to give your garden the nutrients it needs while keeping waste to a minimum.
