# Food for the Soil

**Food for the Soil**  
*24 March 2016*

## Why add organic material?

Adding organic matter gives your garden a **boost** in several ways:

- **Improves soil structure** – makes the soil more crumbly and easier to work.
- **Enhances water‑holding capacity** – keeps moisture in the root zone.
- **Feeds soil life** – more microbes mean more nutrients for your plants.

> *At least 50 % of household waste can become food for the soil.*

## ✅ Useful household waste

These everyday items are perfect for enriching your soil:

- Lawn clippings  
- Floor sweepings & vacuum dust  
- Old hessian or jute sacks  
- Egg shells (crushed)  
- Egg cartons (great for seedlings)  
- Old coir door mats (coconut fibre)  
- Hair & feathers  
- Old linen, cotton or wool clothes (cut up roughly first)  
- Garden trimmings  
- Used tea bags (remove strings & tags)  
- Grass, weeds, etc.  
- Old plants  
- Manure/litter from chickens, rabbits & guinea pigs  
- Cow, stable or pigeon manure  
- Shredded paper or old newspaper/phone books (soaked in water)  
- Cardboard made from wood  
- Bones  
- Old leather  
- Natural fibre rags  
- Burnt sticks, wood ash, soot  
- Sawdust  
- Leaves  
- Coffee grounds  
- Seaweed  
- Fish waste  
- Hoofs & horns  
- Blood & bone  

> **Can it rot? Bury it!**  
> A good rule of thumb: *Was it once alive? Can it rot?* If yes, it’s a great soil food.

## ❌ Items that won’t feed the soil

Sort these into recycle or garbage bins:

- Soft drink or beer cans

## Other sources of soil food

| Source | Why it’s useful | How to get it |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Horse manure** | Adds chaff, straw & nitrogen from urine | Ask a local horse owner or stable |
| **Lawn clippings/leaves** | Rich in organic matter | Neighbours or local gardeners |
| **Spoilt hay bales** | Cheap, nutrient‑rich | Local grain & produce store |
| **Shredded office paper** | Plain white, non‑glossy | Office suppliers |
| **Pine needles** | Natural mulch, high in acidity | Under old pine trees (usually yours) |
| **Council green waste** | Already mulched & composted | Check with your local council |
| **Wood shavings & sawdust** | Adds organic matter | Timber mills or joinery shops (avoid treated wood) |
| **Cow & sheep manure** | Abundant in rural areas | Stockyards, milking sheds, shearing sheds |
| **Poultry manure** | High nitrogen | Your own chickens, neighbours, or farms |
| **Seaweed** | Nutrient‑rich, especially for coastal gardens | Beach or lake/estuary rakes (check local rules) |

*Not every source will be available, but a diverse mix will build a balanced, nutrient‑rich soil.*

## What to do with all this material?

Your approach depends on the type of garden you’re planning:

- **Traditional compost heap** – pile it up, turn regularly, and let it decompose before use.
- **Direct incorporation** – mix the material into your soil or growing medium and let it break down as you grow.

Either way, you’ll be turning everyday waste into a powerful ally for your plants.
