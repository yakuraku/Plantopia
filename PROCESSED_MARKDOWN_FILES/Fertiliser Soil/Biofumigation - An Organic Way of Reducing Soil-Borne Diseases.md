Great soil is the foundation of gardening success. The best soil is **fertile, well‑structured, and as free of disease and pests as possible**. While digging in homemade compost can improve structure and fertility, most people still rely on chemical treatments to tackle soil‑borne pathogens—an approach that carries ecological risks.  

Enter **biofumigation**: a completely natural, easy‑to‑implement method that boosts soil quality *and* suppresses many pathogens.

## How Does Biofumigation Work?  

At first glance, biofumigation looks a lot like growing a green manure to suppress weeds and add nutrients. The difference?  
- **Cover crops** are sown, allowed to grow until just before seed set, then cut and incorporated into the soil.  
- **Biofumigation crops** are chosen for their high levels of **glucosinolates** (found in mustard, radish, and many brassicas).  
- When the plant material decomposes, glucosinolates break down into a range of **toxic compounds** that naturally defend against:  
  - Nematodes  
  - Fungal spores (e.g., *Verticillium* wilt in tomatoes)  
  - Other soil‑borne pathogens

## How to Biofumigate Your Soil  

For home gardeners, the simplest route is to grow the biofumigant plants directly in the beds you want to treat. Even better: use a **biofumigation seed mix** that blends several species for a more comprehensive effect.  

Follow these **seven easy steps**:  

1. **Clear the bed**  
   - Remove all weeds and any remaining crop residue.  

2. **Sow the seed mix**  
   - Follow the packet instructions for seed rate and spacing.  

3. **Let it grow**  
   - Leave the plants undisturbed until just before they start seeding.  
   - Peak glucosinolate levels occur when the plants have flowered.  
   - Avoid letting them fully mature to prevent self‑seeding weeds.  

4. **Cut back the crop**  
   - Use a hoe, lawn edger, or even a mower.  
   - Shred the cuttings finely but leave them on the soil surface.  

5. **Incorporate the material**  
   - Dig the shredded plant matter firmly into the soil as soon as possible.  
   - Water well and lightly compact the surface to help seal in the fumigating gases.  

6. **Optional: Cover with plastic**  
   - A plastic sheet traps heat and moisture, speeding up decomposition and trapping gases.  
   - Only necessary in cool climates where rotting is slow.  

7. **Wait and aerate**  
   - After 2 – 4 weeks, the cuttings should have rotted and released their natural fumigants.  
   - Fork the soil to aerate, allowing any remaining gases to dissipate before sowing the next crop.
