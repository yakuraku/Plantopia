# Soil Nutrient Deficiencies: A Quick Reference Guide  

*Published 15 February 2020*

## Why Soil Nutrition Matters  
Every plant—whether it’s a daisy, a basil stalk, a tomato vine, or an apple tree—depends on the minerals in the soil to grow strong and healthy. When a key nutrient is missing, plants will show unmistakable signs of distress and overall growth will suffer.  

The good news? Once you spot the symptoms, correcting a deficiency is usually simple.

## How Deficiencies Show Up  
- **Older leaves first** – the classic “older‑leaf” deficiencies  
- **Youngest leaves first** – the “young‑leaf” deficiencies  
- **Any age** – some nutrients affect all leaves but appear most in the middle growth stage

## Older‑Leaf Deficiencies  
These minerals tend to show symptoms in the plant’s older foliage before moving to newer growth.

| Mineral | Key Symptoms | What It Means |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **Nitrogen** | Yellowing leaves, stunted growth, leaf drop, premature maturity | Low chlorophyll → poor photosynthesis |
| **Cobalt** | Same as nitrogen, but **only in legumes** (peas, beans, nuts) | Essential for legume nitrogen fixation |
| **Magnesium** | Pale leaves with yellow patches; veins and stem tips stay green | Magnesium is the core of chlorophyll |
| **Potassium** | Yellowing leaves, brownish‑red scorching at edges, discolored spots with paler halos | Affects water balance and enzyme activity |
| **Phosphorus** | Stunted growth, leaf drop, dead brown spots at leaf edges | Needed for energy transfer (ATP) |
| **Molybdenum** | Speckled discoloration, curling/cupping leaves, malformed stems | Enables nitrate reduction |

## Young‑Leaf Deficiencies  
These minerals first affect the newest leaves, then spread outward.

| Mineral | Key Symptoms | What It Means |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **Calcium** | Leaf tips hook sharply downward → blackened leaves → plant death | Calcium strengthens cell walls |
| **Sulphur** | Widespread yellowing, underdeveloped leaves with curled edges | Sulphur is part of amino acids |
| **Iron** | Yellowing, pale, or translucent leaves; veins stay green | Iron is crucial for chlorophyll synthesis |
| **Copper** | Leaf tip death, yellowing, malformed growth; flower production drops | Copper aids photosynthesis and lignin formation |
| **Zinc** | Underdeveloped leaves in bunches, yellow/white mottled appearance | Zinc regulates growth hormones |
| **Boron** | Margins turn yellow → blacken, crumple, die back from tips | Boron is vital for cell wall structure |

## Mid‑Growth Deficiency  
Affects leaves of any age but often shows up in the middle growth stage.

| Mineral | Key Symptoms | What It Means |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **Manganese** | Yellowing between veins; veins turn pale, sickly green and lose definition | Often appears in waterlogged soils |

## When Multiple Deficiencies Occur  
If your soil is very poor, several deficiencies can overlap, making symptoms harder to parse.  

**Tip:** Take a soil test or use a plant tissue test kit to confirm the exact nutrient gaps.

## Fixing the Problem  
1. **Identify** the deficient mineral(s).  
2. **Apply a targeted feed**:  
   - *Nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus* need specific fertilizers.  
   - For trace elements (iron, zinc, copper, etc.), an **all‑in‑one corrective element solution** usually suffices.  
3. **Follow label instructions** for dosage and timing.  
4. **Monitor** plant response over the next few weeks; improvement should be visible.

**Remember:** A balanced soil is the foundation of a thriving garden. Spotting and correcting nutrient deficiencies early keeps your plants vibrant and productive.
