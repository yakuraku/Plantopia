> *Gardening On a Budget: 10 Easy, Frugal Ideas*

In the book *The $64 Tomato*, author **Bill Alexander** described the year he decided to set up a productive garden. When he added up everything he’d spent—including tools and landscaping—Bill worked out that each gourmet tomato he’d grown had cost an eye‑watering **US$64**!  

Although humorous, the lesson that budgets can quickly blow out in the garden is clear to seasoned growers. With a bit of planning and sensible decision‑making, gardening doesn’t have to be an expensive hobby. Below are **10 budget‑busting ideas** that will help you save dollars while still enjoying the process and harvesting abundantly.

---

## 1. Grow From Seed

- **Seeds are the cheapest starting point**: a packet of seeds often costs less than a single nursery‑bought seedling.
- **You’ll get an entire season’s worth** of plants from one packet.
- **Variety is endless**: choose from a huge range of cultivars to suit your taste and climate.

## 2. Make Your Own Compost and Fertiliser

- **Buying soil is a major expense**; improving what you already have is far more economical—and sustainable.
- **Compost turns waste into nutrient‑rich soil**: use grass clippings, leaves, and food scraps that would otherwise go to landfill.
- **Compost supplies everything plants need**, reducing the need for pricey commercial fertilisers.
- **Optional boost**: brew *compost tea* or a foliar feed for free.

## 3. Reuse and Recycle Pots and Labels

- **Seedling trays can add up**; reuse them by sterilising between uses.
- **DIY pots**: newspaper, eggshells, or even old containers.
- **Plant labels**: cut ice‑cream or yoghurt containers into strips, or reuse paddle‑pop sticks.

## 4. Grow Super‑Productive Crops

- **Maximise yield per square foot** by choosing high‑yield varieties.
- **Top performers**: zucchini, pumpkins, squash, climbing beans, tomatoes, rhubarb, and “cut‑and‑come‑again” salad leaves.
- **More harvest = more sharing or preserving**.

---

## 5. Time Your Planting

- **Wrong timing wastes money**: seeds sown in unsuitable soil temperatures may fail to germinate or produce weak seedlings.
- **Use seed packets or a sowing chart** to find the optimal planting window for your climate.
- **A small soil thermometer** is a worthwhile investment that removes guesswork.

---

## 6. Plant Realistic Amounts of Each Variety

- **Avoid over‑sowing**: too many seedlings crowd the space and reduce yield.
- **Space plants as recommended** for best growth.
- **Plant just enough** to fill your garden, plus a few spares for poor germination or to share with friends.

---

## 7. Swap and Share Crops

- **Expand your variety without extra cost** by swapping or sharing with neighbours.
- **Find local growers** through freecycle, “buy‑nothing” groups, or community gardens.
- **Enjoy a wider selection** of fruit and vegetables than you could grow alone.

---

## 8. DIY Pest and Weed Sprays

- **Commercial sprays can add up** and often sit unused in the shed.
- **Homemade solutions** are simple, effective, and use household items: bicarbonate of soda, vegetable oil, soap, etc.
- **Keep your garden healthy** without breaking the bank.

---

## 9. Care for Your Equipment

- **Invest in quality tools** only if you’ll maintain them.
- **Clean and oil** tools after each use; sharpen secateurs regularly.
- **Store in a dry, weather‑protected place** to extend lifespan.
- **Clean, sharp tools** are easier to use and less likely to spread disease.

---

## 10. Save Seeds

- **The ultimate money‑saver**: next year’s plants for free.
- **Start with peas and beans**, then move to tomatoes, chillies, and many flowers.
- **Research seed viability** to ensure they’ll grow true to type.
