*Calendula Officinalis* offers a riot of orange, yellow, and cream across an exceptionally long flowering period.

## Calendula or Marigold?  
**Clarify the name** before you plant.

- **Common names**: pot marigold, English marigold, common marigold.  
- **Botanical truth**: It belongs to the *Calendula* genus, not the *Tagetes* marigolds that came from the Mediterranean.  
- **Why it matters**: If you’re after the culinary and wellness benefits, you need *Calendula officinalis* (pot marigold). Other “marigolds” can be inedible or even toxic.

---

## Appearance at a Glance  
- **Family**: Asteraceae (sunflowers, daisies).  
- **Flowers**: Bright yellow or orange; cream, pink, and other varieties exist. Single‑ and double‑petalled types are bred.  
- **Plant**: Bushy annual, 40–45 cm tall, dense clumps of spatula‑shaped leaves.  
- **Texture**: Stems and leaves are slightly hairy and sticky—an easy way to spot them versus smoother, non‑culinary marigolds.

## Calendula in the Garden  
- **Growth habit**: Vigorous, undemanding, often found wild on wasteland.  
- **Flowering season**: *Long‑lasting*—almost year‑round in milder climates.  
- **Companion plant**: Attracts ladybugs, bees, lacewings, hoverflies.  
- **Invasive potential**: Can spread if not managed; keep an eye on unwanted colonies.

## Calendula in the Kitchen  
- **Flavor**: Mild saffron‑like taste.  
- **Uses**:
  - Dried, ground petals → bright, saffron‑like flavor for rice dishes (cheaper than saffron).  
  - Fresh petals → snip over salads, light soups, or garnish cakes and desserts.  
- **Leaves**: *Not recommended* for salads or as a vegetable—usually bitter, though not harmful.

## Calendula in the Medicine Cabinet  
- **“Officinalis”**: Indicates a long history of medicinal use.  
- **Common uses**: Treat mild burns, rashes, superficial cuts.  
- **DIY remedies**:
  1. Infuse dried petals in water or neutral oil.  
  2. Sieve and apply directly to the affected area.  
- **Safety tip**: Some people have mild allergic reactions to daisies.  
  - **Test first**: Apply a diluted mixture to a small skin area.  
  - **External use only**: Calendula tea should be used outside the body.

## Growing & Harvesting Calendula  
### Planting  
| Step | Details |
|------|---------|
| **When** | Sow seeds from early spring onward. |
| **Where** | Seed modules, 20 cm × 20 cm containers, or open soil. |
| **Spacing** | 45 cm apart (each way). |
| **Depth** | 1 cm deep (darkness needed for germination). |
| **Water** | Keep moist until germination (~1 week). |
| **Transplant** | If indoors, move seedlings when 5–7 cm tall. |

### Care  
- **Sun**: Full sun.  
- **Soil**: Well‑draining, moisture‑retentive.  
- **Watering**: Moderate; avoid over‑watering.  
- **Fertilizer**: Optional – a fortnightly liquid rose feed can boost blooms.  
- **Weeding**: Keep beds tidy.

### Blooming  
- **First flowers**: 6–8 weeks after germination.  
- **Duration**: Summer, autumn, early winter; frost‑free winters may bring a second bloom in early spring.  
- **Cutting**: Flowers close in low light, so they’re best kept in the garden or used fresh.

### Harvesting & Drying  
- **When to cut**: Late morning, petals fully open.  
- **Method**: Cut whole head, trim green stem with sharp scissors.  
- **Drying**:
  - Warm room, 2 days.  
  - Dehydrator for faster drying.  
- **Pro tip**: Regular cutting and removing seed heads prolong the flowering season.  
- **Self‑seeding**: Leaving some heads in place helps next year’s growth.
