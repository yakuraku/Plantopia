## What is Cosmos?

**Cosmos (_Cosmos bipinnatus_)** is a warm‑season annual that hails from Mexico. Thanks to modern breeding, you can now find a *wide spectrum of colors and forms*—from single to double flowers, dwarf to tall, ruffled, pleated, fused petals, variegated or striped blooms, and muted, on‑trend hues.

## Cosmos as Cut Flowers

Why choose cosmos for your cutting garden?  
- **Fast, hassle‑free growth** – they’re a reliable source of blooms.  
- **Cut‑and‑come‑again** – harvest repeatedly from the same plant throughout the season.  
- **Long flowering window** – from mid‑spring to the end of autumn.  
- **Self‑seeding** – free plants for the next year.  
- **Versatile look** – from natural, wild‑flower vibes to refined, romantic touches.  

*Note:* Cosmos have a **short vase life (4–6 days)**, but picking **branched stems** extends this, as side buds will open as the central flower fades.

## Varieties Suited to Cutting

When selecting cosmos for cut flowers, aim for a **stem length of at least 60 cm**; dwarf and low‑growing types won’t give you long enough stems for most arrangements.  

| Variety | Highlights |
|---------|------------|
| **Cupcakes** | Romantic, large bowl‑shaped flowers with fused petals; soft pastel colors; pinked edges reminiscent of cupcake paper. |
| **Rubenza** | Starts deep rose‑pink, fades to rich terracotta; a favorite among floral designers. |
| **Velouette** | Tall stems with large mahogany flowers overlaid with white stripes; bicolored blooms bridge white, burgundy, or deep pink. |
| **Rosetta** | Mix of single and collarette flowers; striped petals that look hand‑painted. |
| **Lemonade / Apricot Lemonade** | Shorter stems but unique muted colors; still worth a spot in the cutting garden. |

## How to Grow Cosmos for a Continuous Supply of Cut Flowers

1. **Planting**  
   - **Direct sow** from seed, or start indoors **3 weeks before the last frost** (or a few weeks earlier in frost‑free areas).  
   - **Succession sow** every month; aim for **2–3 plantings per season** to keep the supply steady.  

2. **Spacing**  
   - For a cutting garden, space **~30 cm apart** (taller varieties).  
   - *Tip:* Slightly closer spacing encourages mutual support and can help keep stems straighter.  

3. **Care**  
   - **Avoid over‑fertilizing** and overwatering; too much can lead to lush foliage but fewer flowers.  
   - **Pinch** to promote branching: when plants reach **20–30 cm**, snip the top 10 cm just above a leaf set.  
   - **Support** with netting or string between stakes to keep stems upright and straight.  

4. **Harvesting**  
   - Cut when buds show color but **before they open** and before pollination.  
   - Prefer **branch cuts** over single stems; when the central flower fades, side buds will bloom, extending vase life.  
   - **Deadhead** regularly to keep plants flowering longer.
