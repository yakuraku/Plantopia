# Top Tips for Growing Sensational Sweetpeas

*30 August 2025*  
**Sweetpeas** (*Lathyrus oderatus*) are Mediterranean natives that climb walls, spreading gorgeous scents and colors. Their showy flowers come in white, purple, and pink—yellow remains elusive!

> **Pro tip:** In Australia, St Patrick’s Day is the perfect time to plant these climbing annuals. In Ireland, the wet, cold weather keeps gardeners indoors, so sweetpeas stay true to their European roots and prefer cool soil to germinate. If your soil may be too hot in mid‑March, start them indoors or wait a few more weeks to sow them outside.

## Which Sweetpea Should I Grow?

Sweetpea seeds come in **early, mid, or late flowering** varieties. Pick one that matches your climate and the season you plan to sow. All varieties can be sown in autumn or spring, but they’re bred for specific daylight hours.

| Flowering Time | Daylight Needed | Varieties & Highlights |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Very early** | 10 h | • **Solstice** – flowers in winter; plant from winter into spring.<br>• **Multiflora** – early flowering, great for cut flowers, suits warm climates. |
| **Early** | 11 h | • **Mammoth** – large flowers, ideal for warm climates; keep cutting flowers regularly to extend blooming.<br>• **Streamers** – large, showy flowers streaked with white. |
| **Late** | 12 h+ | • **Spencer** – large, frilly, fragrant flowers; favorite in England, suits temperate climates. |
| **Dwarf** | – | Perfect for containers and hanging baskets; no long trailing stems, no trellis needed. |
| **Perennial** | – | *Lathyrus latifolius* (Everlasting Sweetpea) produces white flowers year after year. Label after flowering to avoid accidental digging. Usually unscented but adds a distinctive touch to mixed vases. |

## 7 Tips for Successful Growing

1. **Pre‑soak & Scarify**  
   *Soak seeds in water for 24 h* so they swell. Scarifying—gently rubbing the seed coat with fine sandpaper at the root‑emergence point—can boost germination. Both steps are optional but helpful. Keep seedlings moist until they sprout.

2. **Prepare Deep Beds**  
   Sweetpeas have deep roots. Dig a trench **≥ 60 cm** deep to keep weeds from competing. Choose a sunny spot with good drainage and rich soil. Add a layer of compost and aged manure, mix well, and you’re ready to sow.

3. **Get the pH Right**  
   Sweetpeas dislike acidic or poor soil. Aim for a pH of **7–8**. If your soil is acidic, spread **100 g of lime or dolomite per square meter** by hand, then water it in. This “sweetens” the soil and promotes healthy growth.

4. **Sow Properly**  
   *Depth:* 25 mm  
   *Spacing:* 15 cm apart  
   Close spacing can cause leaf mildew, so give each plant room. Sweetpeas are usually sown directly in the garden, but you can start them indoors in pots until the soil cools (13–18 °C). Mulch after planting to keep the soil cooler—especially useful in warm climates.

5. **Pinch Out Seedlings**  
   When seedlings reach **10–15 cm**, pinch or cut the central growing tip, leaving 2–3 leaf sets. This encourages branching, giving you more stems and more flowers.

6. **Provide Support**  
   Use a **tripod, bamboo trellis, or fence**. Sweetpea tendrils love anything to cling to. Traditional “Pea sticks” (small stakes from other branches) work well. Guide tendrils early on, but avoid tying too tightly—tight knots can damage stems as they grow. Kids love helping!

7. **Pick Flowers Often**  
   The more you pick, the more they grow! Leaving flowers on the stems pushes the plant toward seed production. Even if you’re not using them for a vase, **deadhead** regularly. For cut flowers, pick stems when at least two unopened buds remain at the tip.

> **Safety note:** Sweetpeas are toxic if ingested by children or pets. Store them out of reach and keep them away from food.
