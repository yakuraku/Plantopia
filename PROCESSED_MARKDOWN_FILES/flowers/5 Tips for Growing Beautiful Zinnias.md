*5 Tips for Growing Beautiful Zinnias*  

Zinnias are such popular flowers. Coming in **numerous colours and sizes**, the flowers are available in *double, semi‑double* and *single* varieties. The plants are easy to grow from seed, fast to germinate, and produce blooms in **around 90 days**, making them perfect for both beginning gardeners and experienced flower farmers. Treated as a “cut‑and‑come‑again” crop, zinnias can flower from **early summer through to autumn**.

**Key planting facts**

- **Frost‑sensitive annuals** – sow directly in the garden or raise seedlings for transplanting in warm weather.  
- **Heat lovers** – choose a spot that receives **at least 6 hours of direct sun** each day.  
- **Spacing** – dwarf varieties: 15 cm apart; taller varieties: 30 cm apart; rows: 30–45 cm apart.

## 1. Grow Strong Seedlings

- Zinnias originated in Mexico and thrive in hot weather.  
- **Wait until summer heat** before planting seeds directly. In cool temperate climates such as Melbourne, hold off until **November or December**; in warmer regions, you can start in early spring.  
- When raising seedlings, use **jiffy pots or soil pellets** to minimise root disturbance.  
- **Zinnias dislike transplant shock** – keep the root ball intact when moving seedlings into the garden.

## 2. Pinch Young Plants

- Pinching encourages **more flowers, longer stems, and stronger growth**.  
- When seedlings reach **≈20 cm** tall and have at least **three pairs of true leaves**, pinch off the top **8–10 cm** of growth just above a leaf set.  
- Use **sharp pruners or snips** for a clean cut.  
- This stimulates **branching**, leading to a bushier plant and a fuller display of blooms.

## 3. Avoid Fungal Infections

- Common issues:  
  - *Powdery mildew* – white coating on the upper leaf surface.  
  - *Leaf spot diseases* – reddish or brown spots.  
- **Water the soil, not the foliage**.  
- Opt for **drip irrigation** or water at the base of the plant.  
- Water in the **morning** so leaves dry before nightfall.  
- Proper **spacing** improves airflow, making fungal infections harder to establish.

## 4. Provide Support

- Professional growers use horticultural netting to keep stems upright.  
- For home gardeners:  
  - **Tall varieties** – use thin **bamboo stakes**.  
  - **Shorter varieties** – set up a **string guide** around the bed to corral plants and encourage upright growth.  
- Avoid planting in windy spots where stems may snap or plants could be blown over.

## 5. Encourage More Flowers

- Once blooms appear, **deadhead** or harvest flowers regularly.  
- Leaving flowers on the plant allows bees to pollinate and the plant to go to seed, which stops new flower production.  
- Pick flowers **when fully open** to keep the plant producing.
