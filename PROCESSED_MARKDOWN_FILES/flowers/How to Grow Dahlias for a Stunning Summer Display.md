*How to Grow Dahlias for a Stunning Summer Display*

---

## Why Dahlias Are a Border‑Star

- **Vibrant variety**: From dainty 5 cm blooms to 30 cm showpieces, dahlias come in *white, yellow, orange, pink, purple* and countless shades in between.  
- **Long‑lasting color**: They flower from **summer through late autumn**, giving borders weeks of flamboyant color.  
- **Cut‑flower champion**: Their dramatic shapes and rich hues make them a favorite for bouquets and arrangements.

*Origin*: Central America and Mexico, first described in the late 18th century.  
*Family*: Daisy family – the classic daisy look is unmistakable.

Breeding has produced two main styles:

| Type | Typical Height | Bloom Size | Use |
|------|----------------|------------|-----|
| **Bedding / Garden** | 30–60 cm | 5–10 cm | Ground cover, borders |
| **Large/Show** | 60–120 cm | 10–30 cm | Centerpieces, cut flowers |

## Choosing the Right Variety

- **Short bedding types**: Ideal for tight borders or container gardening.  
- **Tall show types**: Need wind protection and staking.  
- **Color mix**: Seed is economical for a rainbow of colors; tubers guarantee a specific cultivar.

## Location & Soil Preparation

1. **Planting window**  
   - **September – December** (after the last frost).  
2. **Sunlight**  
   - *Full sun* is best.  
   - In hot areas, *morning sun + dappled afternoon shade* keeps plants from scorching.  
3. **Soil**  
   - **Finely textured, fertile**: Work in plenty of compost or blood‑and‑bone.  
   - **Excellent drainage**: Dahlias rot if they sit in wet soil.  
4. **Wind & Staking**  
   - Taller varieties benefit from windbreaks.  
   - **Stake** the largest, top‑heavy types to keep them upright.  
5. **Containers**  
   - Use **large, heavy pots** for tall varieties to avoid tipping.

## Planting the Tubers

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | **Remove tubers** from packaging immediately. If you can’t plant right away, store them horizontally in a tray covered with *slightly damp coir or sawdust*. Check them regularly. |
| 2 | **Locate the eye** (growing point). Look for a shoot or a remaining stem section. |
| 3 | **Plant position**: Lay tubers horizontally, eye **upward**, 10 cm deep, 40 cm apart. |
| 4 | **Stake** while planting if needed—use one stake for a pair of plants, one on each side. |
| 5 | **Cover & water**: Backfill with soil, water well, then **hold off watering** until shoots appear to reduce rot risk. |

## Ongoing Cultivation

- **Watering**  
  - *Regular, light*—avoid deep soaks.  
- **Fertilizing**  
  - Dahlias are heavy feeders.  
  - Apply **low‑nitrogen fertilizer** or a layer of well‑rotted compost **twice** during summer, starting when plants reach ~20 cm.  
- **Pinching**  
  - When plants are ~40 cm tall (4–5 leaf sets) and before buds form, pinch the growing tips.  
  - Benefits: *Better blooms*, *thinner stems* (great for cut flowers).  
- **Deadheading**  
  - Cut fading blooms or remove seed‑setting flowers to encourage new growth.  
- **Post‑flowering care**  
  - Prune back to **half height** while leaving some foliage to replenish tubers.  
  - When leaves turn color in late autumn/early winter, cut plants back to **10 cm** above the soil for overwintering.

## Should Dahlias Be Lifted?

- **Mild winters**: Tubers can stay in the ground; just keep soil well‑draining.  
- **Risk of rot**: Lift tubers, store in damp coir or sawdust, cool and dark, but never dry out completely.  
- **Every few years**: Lift to prevent overcrowding, divide clumps, and create new plants—each division must have its own eye.

## Common Pests & Diseases

| Issue | Symptoms | Prevention & Control |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| **Slugs & Snails** | Chewed leaves, soft spots | Beer traps, evening patrols, organic pellets |
| **Powdery Mildew** | White powder on leaves | Proper spacing, ground watering, morning watering, remove affected plants |
| **Mosaic & Wilt Viruses** | Mottled or crinkled leaves, deformed growth | Control aphids, sterilize snips (10 % bleach), dispose of infected plants |
| **Crown Gall** | Small swellings at stem base | Avoid sharing infected tubers, treat with good hygiene |
