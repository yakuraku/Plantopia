*Marigolds: A Highlight of the Autumn Garden*

## History and Uses of Marigolds

- **Tagetes** – the genus that houses about 50‑odd species, almost all native to the American tropics and subtropics.  
- Mostly upright **annuals** and **perennials** in the daisy family, they flaunt daisy‑like blooms in striking warm hues—red, orange, yellow—above ferny, aromatic green foliage.  
- Brought from South America to Spain in the early 16th century, they quickly naturalised across Europe, North Africa, and India.  
- In Spain, the flowers were called *“Mary’s Gold”* (later shortened to *marigold*), a nod to their bright, “golden” appearance.  
- The genus name derives from **Tages**, the grandson of Jupiter, who sprang from the plowed earth—apt for a plant that *pops up* from seed.  
- **Cultural significance**:  
  - Mexican, Spanish, and Indian traditions use marigolds to decorate altars and celebrate festivals.  
  - Medicinally, the petals soothe minor skin injuries—cuts, eczema, sunburn.  
  - As a natural dye, they produce a mustard‑to‑saffron yellow hue.  
  - **Edible**: Sprinkle petals over salads, cakes, or desserts for a pop of colour and subtle flavour.

## Marigolds in the Garden

- **Companion planting**: Their strong scent repels flying pests like *whitefly* and *carrot fly*, making them ideal around tomatoes.  
- **Pollinator magnet**: Butterflies and bees love the bright blooms—watch them flutter for a garden spectacle.  
- **Growth habit**:  
  - Rapidly reach maturity, offering vivid colour from late spring through autumn.  
  - **Pinch back** each flower head as it fades to encourage continuous reblooming.  
- **Seasonal behaviour**:  
  - In warm climates, they may bloom year‑round.  
  - In cooler regions, they die back in winter and after their final flush.

## Common Pests and Diseases

| Issue | What to Watch For | Quick Fix |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Spider mites** | Tiny, speckled spots on leaves | Mix a gentle soap spray and apply to tops and undersides of leaves. |
| **Slugs & snails** | Chewing holes in seedlings | Use barriers (e.g., crushed eggshells) or organic slug bait. |
| **Mold & mildew** | White fuzzy patches, especially in humid areas | Ensure good air circulation; treat early with eco‑fungicide. |

*Tip*: Space plants generously to keep airflow high and reduce disease risk.

## Drying Marigold Flowers

1. **Pick** stems when blooms are fully open and disease‑free.  
2. **Hang** small bunches upside‑down in a **dry, dark** spot (e.g., inside a cupboard).  
3. **Check** regularly for mould.  
4. **Catch** any fallen petals with paper bags secured by clothespins.  
5. **Display**:  
   - Store dried heads in glass jars for a vibrant table centerpiece.  
   - Use petals or leaves in potpourri for fragrance and colour.

## How to Save Marigold Seeds

1. **Pinch** dead flower heads off the plant.  
2. **Set aside** at least **five heads** for seed saving, ensuring you have one of each colour.  
3. **Dry** the heads on a paper towel indoors for **one week** to guarantee full dryness.  
4. **Store** the dried heads in a glass jar over winter.  
5. **Spring**: Break open the heads to reveal black seeds with long white tails.  
6. **Plant**:  
   - Start indoors in late winter, or  
   - Scatter directly in the garden in early spring.

*Result*: Free marigolds for the next season—and many more to come!
