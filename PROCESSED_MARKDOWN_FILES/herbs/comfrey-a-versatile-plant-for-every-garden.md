**Comfrey**  
A staple in permaculture worldwide, comfrey is a garden‑loving perennial that pulls nutrients from deep below the surface and turns them into a living mulch, compost booster, and even a natural remedy.

## What Is Comfrey?

- **Scientific name:** *Symphytum officinale*  
- **Size:** Up to **1.2 m** tall  
- **Leaves:** Large, hairy, grey‑green rosettes  
- **Flowers:** Bell‑shaped mauve clusters  
- **Origin:** Europe, now thriving from cool temperate to tropical zones  

**Root power**  
Comfrey’s taproot can reach **up to 2 m** in ideal conditions, tapping into nutrients that shallow‑rooted plants miss. When you chop its leaves for mulch or compost, you’re literally bringing those buried nutrients back to the surface—especially handy in rainy areas where leaching is a concern.

## How to Grow Comfrey

### Site & Light  
- **Sun:** Full sun to partial shade (≥ 3 h/day)  
- **Location:** Pick a permanent spot—comfrey spreads vigorously and can become invasive if left unchecked.  
- **Containers:** Works, but nutrient cycling is limited.

### Seeds  
- **Germination:** Up to **30 days**; stratify before sowing to speed up.  
- **Planting times:**  
  - Cool regions: **Autumn** or **Spring**  
  - Subtropical: **Feb–Oct**  
- **Method:** Sow 5 mm deep in trays or punnets at **20–22 °C**.  
- **Spacing:** **60 cm** between plants when transplanting.

### Care  
- **Feeding:** Usually unnecessary; thrives in nutrient‑poor soils.  
- **Watering:** Keep soil consistently moist.  
- **Pruning:** Cut back to ground in late autumn or spring to encourage robust regrowth.  
- **Harvesting:**  
  - First year: **Sparingly**  
  - Subsequent years: As needed  
- **Pests:** Generally pest‑resistant; watch for slugs and snails.

## Practical Uses of Comfrey

> *Note:* Comfrey contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). **Do not eat** it, and feed chickens only in moderation.

| Use | How to Apply | Why It Works |
|-----|--------------|--------------|
| **Pollinator Plant** | Let the purple blooms flourish. | Attracts bees and other pollinators. |
| **Organic Mulch** | Slash leaves and leave them on the soil surface. | Suppresses weeds, retains moisture, slowly releases nutrients. |
| **Compost Accelerator** | Add whole or chopped leaves to the pile. | Increases nitrogen content and speeds decomposition. |
| **Compost Tea** | Steep leaves in water for a few days. | Produces a nutrient‑rich liquid fertilizer. |
| **Chicken Fodder** | Offer small amounts around coops. | High‑protein feed; limit due to PA content. |
| **Poultice (Knitbone)** | Mash or grate roots, mix with water, let dry. | Roots set hard like plaster, aiding bone healing. |
| **Ointments & Creams** | Combine with olive oil or beeswax. | Contains allantoin, promoting cell renewal and anti‑inflammatory effects. |
