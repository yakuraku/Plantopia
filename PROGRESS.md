# Plantopia Recommendation Engine: Project Context Summary

This document provides a complete overview of the Plantopia Recommendation Engine project, including its current status, technical architecture, key challenges resolved, and future roadmap.

## 1. Project Overview & Goal

Plantopia is a full-stack web application designed to provide users with personalized plant recommendations. It analyzes user preferences (e.g., location, sun exposure, gardening goals, maintenance level) and environmental data to suggest the most suitable flowers, herbs, and vegetables from a database of over 2,100 plants. The core mission is to make gardening more accessible and successful for users by providing actionable, data-driven advice.

## 2. Current Status & Latest Updates (As of September 4, 2025)

## 3. Core Technical Architecture

#### Frontend
*   **Framework:** Vue.js 3
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **State Management:** Pinia
*   **Location:** `/frontend/` directory

#### Backend
*   **Framework:** Standard Python `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` (chosen for optimal compatibility with Vercel).
*   **Runtime:** Vercel Serverless Functions.
*   **Primary Logic:** `api/index.py` handles all main API requests.
*   **Dependencies:** `pandas`, `python-dotenv`, `requests`.

#### Data Sources
*   **Plant Data:** Three primary CSV files located in the project root: `flower_plants_data.csv`, `herbs_plants_data.csv`, and `vegetable_plants_data.csv` (totaling 2,117 plants).
*   **Climate Data:** `climate_data.json` contains environmental data for 151+ Melbourne suburbs.
*   **Image Storage:** All plant images are hosted on Google Drive in a nested folder structure.

#### Deployment
*   **Platform:** Vercel
*   **Configuration:** A `vercel.json` file manages build commands, serverless function routing, and static asset serving.
*   **Security:** API keys and sensitive folder IDs are managed securely as environment variables in Vercel, loaded via a `.env` file in development.

## 4. Key API Endpoints

The backend provides a RESTful API to serve the frontend:

*   **`POST /api/recommendations`**
    *   **Purpose:** The core endpoint to generate personalized plant recommendations.
    *   **Request Body:**
        ```json
        {
          "suburb": "Richmond",
          "n": 5,
          "user_preferences": { /* ... detailed user preference object ... */ }
        }
        ```
    *   **Response:** A list of recommended plants, each with a score, a "why" explanation, and media URLs.

*   **`GET /api/plants`**
    *   **Purpose:** Returns the entire database of 2,117+ plants for browsing and catalog features.
    *   **Response:** A JSON object containing a `plants` array and a `total_count`. Each plant object includes its full data sheet and a real Google Drive image URL.

*   **`POST /api/plant-score`**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a detailed scoring breakdown for a single plant against user preferences.
    *   **Request Body:**
        ```json
        {
          "plant_name": "Basil",
          "suburb": "Richmond",
          "user_preferences": { /* ... detailed user preference object ... */ }
        }
        ```
    *   **Response:** The plant's data, overall score, and a detailed breakdown of how it scored in each category (e.g., sun, season, maintenance).

*   **`GET /api/images/{category}`**
    *   **Purpose:** Lists all available Google Drive images for a given plant category (flower, herb, vegetable). Used by the frontend to dynamically fetch image URLs.

*   **`GET /api/health`**
    *   **Purpose:** A simple health check endpoint to confirm the API is running.

## 5. Critical Technical Journey & Resolutions

The project's current stable state is the result of solving a chain of complex technical challenges.

#### Vercel Deployment Challenges (Solved)
1.  **Repository Size:** The initial deployment failed because the 1.85GB repository (containing 800MB+ of images) exceeded Vercel's limits.
    *   **Solution:** Image directories were removed from Git tracking, and a Google Drive hosting strategy was adopted. The repository size was reduced to 16MB.
2.  **Configuration Conflicts:** Deployments failed due to a `vercel.json` conflict between the deprecated `builds` property and the modern `functions` property.
    *   **Solution:** The `vercel.json` was rewritten to exclusively use the modern `functions` and `buildCommand` properties.
3.  **Serverless Function Structure:** Vercel requires Python serverless functions to reside in an `/api/` directory, but the project files were in the root.
    *   **Solution:** The Python API files were moved into the `/api/` directory (e.g., `api_working.py` -> `api/index.py`), and all file paths for data loading were updated accordingly.

#### API Crash & Recommendation Engine Implementation (Solved)
*   **Problem:** The recommendations endpoint was crashing with an HTTP 500 error because a key function (`get_drive_image_url`) was called with one argument instead of the required two.
*   **Solution:** The function call was corrected. More importantly, this fix was bundled with a major enhancement: the placeholder test responses were **replaced with the real, fully implemented recommendation engine**, bringing the core feature to life.

#### Google Drive Image Integration (Solved)
*   **Problem:** The first attempt to show images failed because the API was using Google Drive **folder IDs** instead of **individual file IDs**. A subsequent attempt failed with a 403 Forbidden error due to incorrect API query syntax (`"parents in '{folder_id}'"` instead of `"{folder_id}' in parents"`) and not accounting for the nested subfolder structure where images were stored.
*   **Solution:** A dedicated, secure backend service (`GoogleDriveImageService`) was created. It uses a correct, robust query to scan subfolders, retrieves individual file IDs, and constructs valid image URLs. The API key is securely managed via environment variables, and the frontend calls a proxy endpoint (`/api/images/{category}`) to get image URLs without exposing the key.

## 6. Critical Algorithm & Logic Fixes (Solved)

Two critical bugs in the recommendation logic were identified and fixed, significantly improving the quality of the suggestions.

#### Plant Count Consistency Bug
*   **Problem:** The API would sometimes return 4 plants when 5 were requested, because the diversity rule (max 2 plants per category) would cap the results prematurely.
*   **Solution:** The `category_diversity` function was updated with a **two-pass approach**. The first pass applies the diversity cap. A second pass then fills the remaining slots to meet the `target_count`, ignoring the cap if necessary. This ensures the user always receives the number of recommendations they asked for.

#### Time Preference Scoring Bug
*   **Problem:** The user's preference for `time_to_results` ("quick," "standard," or "patient") was completely ignored by the scoring algorithm, resulting in identical recommendations regardless of this crucial input.
*   **Solution:** The `time_to_results_score` function was rewritten from scratch. It now has distinct logic for each preference, heavily rewarding plants with maturity dates that align with the user's choice (e.g., "quick" preference boosts scores for plants maturing in <75 days, while "patient" boosts scores for plants maturing in >120 days).

## 6. September 4, 2025 Session: Recommendation Engine Implementation

### Problem Identified
The deployed application was showing fallback "Basil" test data instead of real recommendations. User reported that functionality worked on localhost but not in Vercel deployment. Browser logs showed "HTTP/1.0 5..." JSON parsing errors.

### Systematic Debugging & Resolution Process

#### Phase 1: HTTP Response Format Issues (Resolved)
**Problem:** API returning malformed HTTP responses causing JSON parse errors
- Frontend receiving "HTTP/1.0 5..." instead of valid JSON
- Response status showed 200 but body was corrupted

**Root Cause:** Duplicate HTTP header sending
- Code was sending 200 OK headers early in the process
- Exception handlers then sent 500 error headers
- This created malformed HTTP responses

**Solution:**
- Restructured response handling to send headers only once per response path
- Moved success headers to after response data preparation
- Each code path now properly sends headers and returns immediately

#### Phase 2: Function Signature Mismatches (Resolved)
**Problem:** Series of TypeError exceptions in recommendation engine functions

**Systematic Fixes Applied:**
1. **`select_environment()` Parameter Error**
   - Error: `unexpected keyword argument 'climate_zone'`
   - Fix: Changed `climate_zone=` to `cli_override_climate_zone=` to match function signature

2. **`get_user_preferences()` Argument Error** 
   - Error: `takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`
   - Root Cause: Function expects file path to load preferences, not data objects
   - Fix: Removed unnecessary function call, use `user_prefs` data directly in all subsequent calls

3. **`score_and_rank()` Missing Parameter**
   - Error: `missing 1 required positional argument: 'weights'`
   - Fix: Added imported `weights` parameter to function call

4. **`assemble_output()` Argument Structure Error**
   - Error: `takes 4 positional arguments but 5 were given`
   - Root Cause: Incorrect argument structure and return value handling
   - Fix: Pass `(score, plant, scores_breakdown)` as single tuple, access returned recommendations correctly

#### Phase 3: Vercel Environment Compatibility (Resolved)
**Problem:** File path resolution failing in Vercel serverless environment
- Local development used relative paths that don't work in Vercel
- Vercel working directory is project root, not `/api/` directory

**Solution:**
- Updated file loading to use `os.getcwd()` for Vercel compatibility  
- Added fallback path strategies for CSV and JSON files
- All 2117 plants now load successfully from database

#### Phase 4: Frontend Error Handling (Enhanced)
**Improvements Made:**
- Enhanced error logging to capture full backend error responses
- Fixed API URL double slash issue (`/api//recommendations` â†’ `/api/recommendations`)
- Added JSON.stringify for readable error output in console
- Created debug endpoint (`/api/debug`) for backend component testing

### Final Result
**âœ… Complete Success:** Real recommendation engine now processes user preferences through the full algorithm pipeline:
- Loads 2117 plants from CSV databases
- Applies location-based climate filtering
- Scores plants based on sun exposure, maintenance preferences, plant goals
- Returns personalized recommendations with detailed explanations
- Proper placeholder image handling prevents any UI crashes

### Technical Debt Resolved
- All function signatures now properly aligned
- HTTP response handling completely robust
- Error handling provides detailed debugging information
- File path resolution works in both local and production environments
- Frontend properly captures and displays backend errors for debugging
